I'd make sure to keep it moisturized, as the salicylic acid can be very drying and damage your moisture barrier‚Äî even if the skin doesn't feel dry. Should help your skin recover more quickly. ,4,4,0

CHarcoal cleansers are know to ‚Äúpurge‚Äù the skin. You should give it more ham four days before you change because you said you never washed your face before and now you do. All that could have been under the skin and the charcoal brought it out. I would give it a another week. And then reassess the damage. In the mean time try a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment and use moisturizer after washing. ,1,1,0
Hey! I've got pretty much exactly the same problem as you, I'm 23 and my skin has gone to hell ‚òπÔ∏è 
I've been on several different antibiotics to no avail but I've found that Trimethoprim works for me (might be worth asking your doctor to change for something else, doesn't necessarily have to be stronger to be effective!) and change the topical treatment, I've used Differin, Epiduo and now Skinoren and am just seeing a difference now. It's all about patience unfortunately.
It might also be worth giving La Roche Posay's Effaclar range a shot for cleansing/moisturising as this is what my derm recommended for me (on their site it even says 9/10 derms recommend so it must be good!) 
Good luck!! ,2,2,0
I would start off by saying if your skin is kinda freaking out to just give it a break and keep your routine simple! Whenever I‚Äôm having bad breakouts I try to avoid wearing make up. I feel like it helps to get my skin clearer faster. 
definitely start doing a simple morning routine too. I use Micellar water in the morning and really enjoy it. Garnier and simple are both drug store brands that carry nice micellar water. I would also recommend to start wearing sunscreen. Cerave (another drug store brand) has an AM moisturizer with spf 30 in it so you‚Äôll get two in one which is great if you have a hard time following a routine or you‚Äôre kinda lazy in the morning like me. ,1,1,0
Easiest option - Accutane. 

Or you can spend years and thousands of dollars on different products which may only provide short term and partial relief. ,0,0,0
These days doctors are willing to prescribe Accutane even for milder cases and also quite easily if the acne has been persistent and is not responding well to other medications, because the longer acne stays on your skin, greater are the chances of developing scars.,1,1,0
I think where accutane has such proven results a lot of doctors are willing to just use it as and when required. It sounds like you have your head screwed on firmly though so make sure you do your research/ask lots of questions before taking accutane as it is a 'last resort' treatment for a reason.
You can always request that your tries a different course of antibiotics first! ,1,1,0

Hi! I dont have any experiences with any of your prescriptions or retinol.. but i currently purging from BHA myself.. and when i said purging, it‚Äôs like all the ex-pimple i ever had, come to the surface again. 

I know how it feels like to have those marks, inflammations in your face, but be patient. Good things happen to someone who wait right? :) hopefully it happens fast to our face too.. keep smiling!! ,1,1,0
If you really feel like you tried everything, talk to your doctor about Accutane. It‚Äôs one hell of a fucking drug, but it really helps a lot of people. Don‚Äôt take it lightly. ,3,3,0
I'm taking Accutane right now. 40mg 2 times a day (80mg per day) and the side effects for me aren't to bad. Just dryness. Now it will differ from person to person. You do have to get your blood taken monthly, since it is really beating down your liver, it also means you can't drink alcohol in excess. You do have to see the derm monthly. Insurance will cover it if a bunch of cremes you've tried failed. If you are just jumping into Accutane without trying anything else, they won't cover it. It has been controversial because people have reported mood changes, and even suicide. I haven't experienced this (my skin is clearing up, how can I be mad?) but again, it varies person to person. Sorry for the shoddy formating and Grammar, I'm on mobile. Hopefully I answered everything I can for you! ,2,2,0
there are way too many side effects to list. the first time I did accutane it was very cheap, it‚Äôs based off your insurance. I was going to go on it again, but my insurances co-pay went up and it would‚Äôve been too expensive. prices can vary a lot. 
if you‚Äôre a female you will have to go in monthly for a pregnancy test as well as most likely take and pay for birth control. 
I‚Äôve seen some say they had to do blood tests and stuff like that, but I never had to. so it depends on your dermatologist and insurance if you may have to do more or pay more. 
personally i believe only people with severe cystic acne should use it. it didn‚Äôt clear my acne, but it got rid of my cystic acne. and now I‚Äôm using a combination of medications that have cleared my skin with way less side effects and for s lot cheaper. ,0,0,0
I would not yet. I did two runs of accutane and think I have dry skin and hair loss problems now from it. Your acne is not crazy severe and i would look to other remedies first. Do you wash a ton? Overwashing your face can dry it out. I'd say try to keep it simple- it's easy to go crazy with the many acne cure products out there and lose sight of what keeping it simple can do. I found cetaphil cleanser to be light and simple for washing my face, as well as the same companies moisturizers for face. Also, if you shave your facial hair and experience irritation- Try shaving with the cheap disposable BIC single blade sensitive blades (yellow and white colored) - these helped me a lot in preventing shaving from irritating skin and causing acne. 

Sorry if no is not the answer you were looking for on the accutane but I would definitely try to just be gentle with your face, see if you can gradually make slow change toward clearer skin. It won't be a magic cure that suddenly clears you but you may be better off than using harsh drugs. Just my 10 cents. ,2,2,0
Okay mate thank you and I meant once morning one night lol accidently typed it, I think I‚Äôll just continue the usual and use vitamin c serum,1,1,0
Have you seen a dermatologist yet? thats the first step, they will likely put you on other medications before resorting to Accutane ,1,1,0
Accutane is more of a last resort kind of drug. Your skin is not that bad, and you don‚Äôt seem to have crazy sebum production. I would go light with the cleansers, something hydrating preferably with a low pH (the CeraVe hydrating cleanser has been good for me) and a spot treatment. Try something with benzoyl peroxide which is good to dry out spots. One that gave me good results was the Neutrogena Rapid Clear spot treatment. If not BP then get something with adapalene like Differin which now comes over the counter. But if you have tried all of that, I would strongly suggest you go to the derm and get something stronger, but definitely not Accutane.  

If you‚Äôre a picker, get pimple patches. You can get them really cheap on Amazon and they really help.  ,1,1,0
No. You will likely get side effects like other do. I took 10mg on and off for 6 months and I have severely a dry nasal cavity and throat, so much so that I wake up every morning with a soar throat. Did it work? Yes accutane did, was my acne severe enough for it, no. Now I have this annoying project because it has obviously affected my mucous membranes. Not all people get side effects, but a lot do. Only use accutane for very severe acne that doesn't respond to all other treatment. You are also very young, so I hate to say this as I know having acne can be so disheartening, but you have to be patient. ,1,1,0
i've had enough  :( i've been having a lot of breakouts lately... after visiting dermatologist my skin started getting way better than it was... 
p.s. iphone cam sucks :x ,1,1,0
Breakouts can be prevented with a skincare routine and a healthy diet and exercise. If you're young, your acne is most likely hormonal, like mine, so breakouts are unfortunately very common. :/,1,1,0
Do you change your pillowcases frequently? Maybe that could help, too. I would try cutting back on dairy to see if that changes anything then going to see a dermatologist. Good luck!! ,1,1,0
Can‚Äôt agree more. I wasted 4 years cause i was so worried about side effects and all horror stories of Accutane online. That was the biggest mistake in my life. So much lost opportunities and loss of self confidence due to acne in my pinnacle period of my life in my 20s. Side effects are jokes compared to what I got after the treatment.,8,8,0

I was so afraid of accutane that I‚Äôve dealt with severe acne for 18 years. I finally took the plunge five months ago. Congratulations on your success!!,2,2,0
how much does it cost? im asian too, 26 years old and my face is as bad as yours used to be. ,1,1,0
I tend to agree. I did a 7 month course and it was phenomenal. Mine did come back after 3 years but much less severe because it‚Äôs hormonal.  if I ever need it again I would do it in a heartbeat. No regrets. I was ecstatic while on Accutane because it was the means to an end. Never was I depressed while on it. 
OP Your skin looks fabulous!!!! ,1,1,0
I did. Twice. Acne came back a year after the first round. And a year after the second round. Got tinnitus in my right ear from it, and couldn‚Äôt go back on it. It is now 8 years later and I‚Äôm still battling. :-(,1,1,0
I have been fighting acne for over 5 years now. I'm 29 and over it. I have a phobia of getting my blood drawn though, so that has been holding me back from trying Accutane. The mental distress acne has caused has almost pushed me into a breakdown. I need to toughen up!!,1,1,0
I've tried everything, including accutane. 3 times. Any other last hope ideas?,1,1,0
Looks amazing! These before and afters are really keeping me going right now. I'm starting accutane in about 3 weeks, the month waiting period for women seems excruciatingly long right now. I've been resourceful enough over the years to be able to cover my acne enough so I don't feel awful, but I can barely look at myself anymore when I take off my makeup. I wish I had decided to start accutane sooner.,1,1,0
I've heard a lot about spironolactone. I think I will give it a try since I don't want to go on accutane. ,2,2,0
If it's a hormonal issue, you need to go to a doctor. Good luck!,2,2,0
While I agree hormonal issue is definitely something that needs to be addressed by a doctor, varies between people, etc etc, I too had an awful acne flair up after getting off BC. I actually also went off it for emotional reasons, so I feel your pain big time with this whole thing. I also tried fish oil, zinc, cutting dair and have a next to meat-less diet...all that stuff..it didn't do jack. I finally went on spironolactone and it helped!,2,2,0
Could be weeks-months. Exfoliating 2-3 times a week helps,2,2,0
Something like e45 or one of the cheaper alternatives? Simple moisturiser? Vaseline if place carefully could help? ,1,1,0
That‚Äôs where my acne would always hang out. After three years of every face product known to man, what worked was cutting out dairy and soda pop drinks. 
Took almost a month to clear away and even now when I slip up and eat cheese (god I love cheese) I‚Äôll have a mild outbreak warning me to back off that take a week to go away.

Try it out! I recently switched to Differin from Epiduo after discovering my skin really doesn't like benzoyl peroxide. Im about a month in and I still get flaking/peeling but my skin's pretty happy overall :) But you NEED to wear sunscreen, I also didn't realize this was a big reason why it was irritating/peeling my skin so much!

PH levels for body soap are different than the PH levels of a face cleanser. PH levels for body soap tend to be higher, as in more alkaline based, so you get that "squeaky clean" sensation. For your face though, it's good to keep it at 5.5. So, in theory, it's safe to use face cleanser for your body, but not always safe to use body cleanser for your face. ,3,3,0
The face is more sensitive than the rest of your skin, so it needs a different product. However, anything you can use on your face you can use on your body (just avoid the sensitive bits),2,2,0

My sister is 18 and she just finished being on accutane for six months. Her skin looked like yours and she has totally cleared up. Her skin is smooth and she is now getting micro-needling for scarring. Even the scars are minimal though. There are side effects but she is so happy. ,25,25,0
Yes! It's a miracle drug. Keep chapstick with you at all times and moisturize your face religiously! It took 5 months for me to clear up and then my skin looked fabulous!,11,11,0

Try it, do the blood tests, if you feel shitty and not well, stop taking it. ,6,6,0
Provided you've tried other options, I'd say yes.  

My acne was similar to yours prior to accutane. 2 years later, I still have no persistent acne. Il get a pimple occasionally for a day or two, nothing more. ,6,6,0
Definitely! The side effects are usually minimal (mostly just dry skin!) and can be monitored, but the results are possibly life changing. Don't hesitate, just do it!,4,4,0
Yes! I am 33 and finished in June of this year. It was life changing and I wish I had one on it at your age. I now have acne scars that I'm still embarrassed by. Take care of yourself during the process and you will be so glad you did it,3,3,0
I finished Accutane back in August and it was the best decision I ever made!,3,3,0
Yes. ,3,3,0
My face was just like yours when I was contemplating too when my doctor suggested, and although the side effects can be bad, the alternative is worse IMO. I took Accutane and have never regretted it since, if I had to go back in time and re-do my decision I would have changed nothing. This is why it's known as the last resort, because it's so powerful.,2,2,0
Absolutely yes dude! Do it. Right now. ,2,2,0
Yes man, especially if you're now uncomfortable the way you are and it's been getting worse. **Remember** once you start accutane most all users will break out worse for a little while as the accutane goes in and clears everything out, then you begin to clear up for good!,2,2,0
Yes x 10000.,1,1,0

You sometimes don't have control over a breakout, it can be part of your hormones,4,4,0
Could be lots of things. What kind of acne is it? It could be from dairy, gluten, or some kind of allergy to food. Could be hair in your face or touching your face often. It could be a bacterial or fungal cause, too. ,2,2,0
We feel you, man. I have been having acne problems since I was 14, had 6mo treatment of Accutane twice and relapsed heavily both times. I'm now 20 and still have to battle it, but it has improved significantly due to my diet. What I have learned over the years is that eating properly makes a gigantic difference. If you're very serious about getting rid of your acne for once and for all you should start controlling what you eat heavily. I for one don't consume any dairy products and stay away from greasy food as well as soft drinks and chocolate. This all works very differently for all kinds of people, I've heard of coffee making people break out heavily and you'll just have to experiment with what works for you and what doesn't. Oh and please don't take Accutane too lightly, that shit seriously fucks with your body...think it over well.,3,3,0
Doxycycline didn't help me too. Same thing happened to me, once I was off the medication, my acne returned,2,2,0
Where is your acne most concentrated? Around the jaw line or all over your face?

Sorry to hear about the rude family remarks, that's really shit. People have no idea how destructive acne can be for your self esteem. ,2,2,0
Also i have tried some creams to treat acne. Like treclinac, fucidin. But they didnt helped me. Only thing that helped me was dyxocycline. But help was only temporary while i was using it and 1 week after. Then acne came back again.,1,1,0
Sounds like it's worth it for you, you've tried so many things already.

I did a 9 month course of Accutane and it completely cleared my skin. For me it was a dietary and mineral deficiency (which I realized after my Accutane course). So I've maintained almost completely clear skin.

If you have access to Accutane and you can afford it, I say go for it. Drink lots of water and take it easy on your joints (you can still go to gym just don't do anything you've haven't been doing already). ,1,1,0
Im near 80kg weight.  I would need like 40mg of accutane per day. That would be like 60euros/month. Its like 1/8 my wage. ,1,1,0
What finally worked for me (28 yrs old, have had acne since my teens) was a retinoid cream, Epiduo Forte. My derm wanted me to try that before accurate because it doesn't have the scary side effects of accutane. I was very disheartened at first, thinking it was just another topical that would fail. Lo and behold, my skin is clear and beautiful. It took about 3 months to see results. Maybe worth a try! Good luck, friend. ,1,1,0
Man thats so fucking weird the same thing happened to me. Last winter i was lifting hard eating like crap taking creatine and protein powder but i was barely breaking out and then i got a bunch of pimples stopped lifting cut out dairy again and it got worse. There must be some correlation there wtf,1,1,0
I would recommend trying washing your face only with cold water and what I've learnt from my oily skin experience is that the fewer products I use, the better my skin feels and it heals faster. I think you should stick to only BP or only SA because they both at the same time can do more harm than help. Also, maybe try lower concentration BP, as I've heard that 2,5 % works just as fine as 10% and doesn't irritate skin that much.
Btw, Zinc and Vitamin D3 supplements really helped me with the oiliness situation, you should try it too.,1,1,0

I just use benzoyl peroxide. Dab it on with a q-tip (maybe hold on spot for 30 seconds or so). Repeat as needed, in the morning and at night. This usually dries stuff out and the blemish goes away within 48 hrs. Cheap and super effective. My skin is super sensitive. 

Edit-Hydrogen peroxide, not benzoyl. Whoops! Sorry about that. ,2,2,0
got it done today, was very simple and straight-forward. the aesthetician said it should only take one treatment, maybe two, and I should wait six weeks for full result. it hurt probably 6/10, it was a real burning sensation but also cool at the same time. she did three zap. it caused immediate redness and some swelling, now two hours later it's gone down and looks less red than before. however i know i can still bruise. ,0,0,0
Acne is very much trial and error, what works for some people doesn't do squat on others. Have you tried neem oil? It's smell is horrendous but it works well for me.,1,1,0

My purge took a month to get bad and start to resolve. 3 months later it was a lot better. Now I‚Äôm at 4 months and I‚Äôm well on my way to not needing makeup every day to cover red marks, and I have no bumps anymore.

Push through the purge. It sucks and it‚Äôs gross and miserable but use the tretinoin as directed and stick with a consistent routine. Totally worth it!!,3,3,0
I personally didn't notice a purge period. This may be because I took it upon myself to ease into using it little by little; 1X/week for two weeks, then 2X/week for a month, etc. paying attention to how my skin was doing and backing off when I felt like it needed a break. That being said, tretinoin saved my skin. I had terrible and inexplicable acne with dark scars and now all my friends tell me how jealous they are of my skin. It's well worth the purge if you want to jump right in.,2,2,0
It‚Äôs worked quite well for me...been using it for 2 years. IÔ∏è get a hormonal breakout or a random pimple still but nothing like it used to be...used to hurt to even smile. IÔ∏è can‚Äôt remember how long it took...my skin was so bad that even if IÔ∏è had a purge period it felt normal. IÔ∏è was doing microderms every week tho too. IÔ∏è want to say IÔ∏è noticed a good difference in the skin about a month in,1,1,0
Not gonna lie, mine lasted a good 5-6 months. It then started helping but I still had a few spots so upped the strength... purge number 2! Now I'm on Tazorac (which I personally think is a lot stronger/more effective than tret) and my skin hardly ever gets spots! Push through, it's honestly worth it. ,1,1,0

I've also had horrific breakouts from B12, and am hypersensitive to all B vitamins. I took Biotin with the hope it could help with hair loss from taking Metformin, and my entire chin was a mountain range of cysts. The only vitamin brands I've found that don't have excessive amounts of B and do not cause me to break out are Flintstones with Iron (I take two) or Vitamin Code by Garden of Life. Perhaps a multivitamin that has the B vitamins, but in modest amounts, would be helpful to you as well.

Oh, speaking of Metformin, I've read that it can contribute to a B12 deficiency, so if that's a medicine you're taking it could be another factor.,1,1,0

I've been dealing with acne for 3 months. My acne would turn into dark spots.  I would try everything to get rid of the dark spots, turmeric, apple cider vinegar,  going vegan, drinking a gallon of water a day. Yet, after doing all this for 3 months, no results. I continued to get more acne and dark spots.  Anyways, my girlfriend suggested I try an African black soap. I'm always skeptical when someone suggest that I try a new product because I've spent hundreds of dollars on products that didn't work. Anyways, I tried this product and the results were amazing. The results in the picture were 4 days apart, literally. The product is called "Shea Moisture Acne Prone & Trouble Skin African Black Soap with Shea Butter." Now I'm no sponsor, I'm here to help others out as I'm on my journey to clear my own acne. I was amazed at how fast my dark spots cleared. I should also note that I would always wake up with at least 1 new pimple every morning. It's been 4 days, and I've only woken up with 1  new pimple. Try this product out and let me know how it goes

I also used a Derma Roller 3 days ago for the first time. I used the roller, then washed my face with the African black soap. I don't know which routine is most effect, but I'm going to continue doing whatever I'm doing. ,10,10,0
What is a derma roller and how does it work,1,1,0
Hey you mind linking a picture of the product you use? Thanks a ton.,1,1,0
Has anyone else used this ?,1,1,0
Maybe. Acne sufferers are usually shown to have vitamin E, A, and zinc deficiencies. So if you're trying to supplement, try those 3. They'll definitely help.,6,6,0
I literally started using epaderm (super gentle for Psoriasis and eczema, safe for babies etc.) One week ago and I'm already noticing a difference. It's really gentle, personally salicylic acid makes everything 10x worse for me so i avoid it like the plague. But if this emmolient continues to work I'm going to preach so much about it. I don't have Psoriasis but it appears to have done the best quick job on my acne.,2,2,0
Easy. Don't use comedogenic products. Study each ingredient in your products and make sure it's less than 3 on the comedogenic scale. If you're lazy, look up the product name on http://www.cosdna.com/ and it'll give you an overview of how comedogenic is is (0-5) and how irritating it is (0-5) based on each ingredient.

Also, avoid makeup. Cleanse 2x a day. Don't touch your face. Change your pillowcases every 3-4 days.,4,4,0

I've had many professional and self applied peels.

It will sting, but burning isn't right...if it's that bad they may have left it on too long. Typically for people not used to peels, you leave them on for MAYBE a minute -2 tops depending on the reaction you're experiencing and you build up the time as you use them more.

I've never scabbed. The worst I've had is minor peeling and drier than normal skin if I didn't moisturize properly. I would avoid prolonged sunlight exposure for a while and drink a lot of water to keep your skin hydrated. 

Maybe wait a month or so for another peel. I do mine at home on my own now and rarely leave them on for over 4-5 minutes now that I've built up a bit of a tolerance.,1,1,0
Cetaphil has SLS & irritants. Read the ingredients and study them for each product you use. If diet is in check, then it's your routine that could be causing breakouts. Stress is kind of an indirect cause but even if you don't have acne, stress is terrible for countless reasons.,2,2,0
You sound like me. Your pores could just be... not the greatest... as in prone to oil. Stress definitely causes my acne and an increase in oil production. For your forehead bumps, try washing with Hibiclens. For your blackheads, try stridex pads (although be careful because they can be irritating). Cetaphil also causes irritation in my skin. Try not to touch your face frequently and wash often, as well as it will spur more oil production. Do you consume dairy? ,1,1,0
Wish It's that easy. The side effects alone are scary üò£,6,6,0
I highly discourage the use of Accutane. It made my skin worse before it got marginally better and never went away. It made me depressed and suicidal. It‚Äôs not worth the mental health risks and doesn‚Äôt work for everybody. It‚Äôs a huge gamble.,2,2,0
I'm starting month two of lymecycline and I'm nearly 27, boy I wish I hadve went to the Dr long before now, but it was only through reddit I even know antibiotics for acne existed.

My acne was pretty mild but consistent up until about 3 yrs ago then it turned cystic ,1,1,0
ya i wish i had started sooner... but my doctor had me trying several creams before he put me on accutane... resulting in many scares that could have been prevented... Accutane worked tho,1,1,0

That's understandable for a student. Anyways, from my experience, any brand of whey protein made  me break out and have diarrhea. The only brand that didn't do any of those is the Gold Standard Whey Protein. ,3,3,0

Hi I‚Äôm a nutrition student.

Eating any sort of protein powder, significantly raises the level of IGF-1 in the body. Which can trigger the m-TOR activity which is responsible for an icrease in sebum production.

Any form of dairy not only raises your bodies circulating IGF-1 but also contains it naturally as well as estrogen and other things you don‚Äôt need.

It is not necessary to get your protein from isolated concentrated sources like this. I get 150 grams of protein per day eating nothing but whole foods.

It‚Äôs not as hard as you think seriously. Getting 300g of protein gives you no extra advantage in the gym and is very detrimental to kidney health. When proteins are broken down they expel their amine nitrogen group. Which needs to be expelled from the body immediately.

If you‚Äôre eating way too much protein your kidneys may struggle to get rid of it and could cause long term damage.

I recommend 3 servings of beans, lots of nuts seeds, and vegetables and fruit too, for enzyme repair,2,2,0
Why would you consume that much scoops of whey protein? That's some Rich Piana shit lol Whey should be an alternative for when you don't consume enough protein by the end of the day. Lay off the scoops and eat your protein, chicken, beef, etc. I personally only drink whey when I have no time in my day, or when I don't meet my micros by the end of the day. ,-1,-1,0

Some dandruff shampoo has salicylic acid in it to kill the bacteria that can cause dandruff. It‚Äôs good for acne and maybe it‚Äôs a higher dose of that ingredient than some face washes have.

How long have you gone without it?    There is always acne waiting to come out before your skin clears up.   It's called a purge.    While I would look into other treatments I would still stay off of the dairy.   ,3,3,0
It takes a full 3-4 months to see it clear when it comes to diet/regimen changes.   Wait it out and if you still don't see a difference than do something else.   I gave up dairy 3 years ago and it has done my skin a world of good.  Hang in there!! ,1,1,0
The no dairy is what cleared those up for me.   You might still get hormonal breakouts even if you stop getting cysts.   If that is the case go see a dermatologist if you can or a clinic that specializes in acne.   They will get you on treatments and products that will clear you up.

I'm on month like 4 of epiduo which is adapalene, so slightly different and just finished my first month of lymecycline. Honestly the lymecycline has made the biggest difference to my skin (nearly 3 weeks break out free!) I'm really just using the adapalene to help with PIE and scarring. ,2,2,0
Today marks the 12 week period that I have been using differin gel and honestly I'm not sure that it's made a difference in my skin.

Stop picking asap!! It‚Äôs probably spreading it. Find a new bad habit...pick at your scalp or fingernails instead...not the best advice but you‚Äôve gotta let your skin heal on your face!

Have you tried proactiv? I know it seems gimmicky but it‚Äôs actually good to have a system. Be really consistent with what you use. Get a face wash with salicylic acid in it. The wash you‚Äôre using now is body wash? I wouldn‚Äôt use it on your face. The skin on your body is tougher than your delicate facial skin. ,2,2,0
Accutane should not be your first choice. It was the only thing that worked for me, but there are many alternatives prior.

Talk to a dermotologist and see about different anti biotics and topicals that may be able to help first. ,2,2,0
Oh my gosh when I was your age I looked like that. I waited until I was 16 now to go on accutane, and my only regret is that I didn‚Äôt do it earlier. I would highly recommend you look into it ASAP. Good luck, PM me if you need anymore info ,1,1,0
Accutane did not work for me. I started on it when I was 13ish. It made my skin worse before getting marginally better but never, ever cured my acne. What‚Äôs worse, it made me extremely depressed and suicidal. It should be no means be anything other than a very reluctant last resort.,1,1,0

There is no set amount of time for the breakouts to go away the biotin needs to get out of your system and there still might be residual breakouts that are under your skin that might come through.

Bless your heart.

I have the same thing that happens with cystic acne on my chin. Actually, I am currently battling this dilemma, but NOT TODAY SATAN.

You know what I‚Äôm going to do? I‚Äôm going to spot treat with BP, but not so much that my little acne monster becomes a dry bag of dirt and looks even worse (I‚Äôm a girl and wear makeup - a lot easier to cover acne when it‚Äôs still relatively normal skin on top, than dry flakey skin). 

I‚Äôm also going to wear a yogurt mask at night (I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve become very preachy about probiotics and yogurt with skincare so I‚Äôll digress). I‚Äôll also up my vitamin C intake along with my leafy veggies.

Next, when my monster calms down and forms a whitehead (usually about one and a half weeks of NO TOUCHING apart from BP application) I will give it a little pop, not worrying about what mess comes out, and clean the affected area.

Next comes my pro tip - hydrocolloid bandaids (blister bandages). They are miracle workers for these things and will help prevent your nasty scab issue. Once I‚Äôve washed my face for the night and opened up my cystic acne a little bit, I will avoid putting moisturizer on that one area and sleep with the hydrocolloid bandaid on my face. This is different than a regular bandaid, as they are designed to draw out infection and nastiness from the wound, and a regular bandaid is designed to prevent the environment from interacting with a wound.

When I wake up, I‚Äôll notice the bandaid has a lot of white stuff on it and the acne is usually just a mark at this point. If it isn‚Äôt, I‚Äôll apply the bandaid for another night. All in all, I‚Äôve spent one and a half weeks on the offending area and my problem is rectified, to be battled again the next month when my hormone surge.,3,3,0

I am dairy free, have been since February for other health reasons. I think I noticed a decent decrease in acne, but I think that eating sugar is a bigger trigger for me (after eating several taffy's on Halloween I now have a few pimples :/)  I second plant milks! I use coconut (again no soy/almond for medical reasons) AND I eat goats milk yogurt. I haven't tried any other goats milk products but my dietician recently suggested goats milk protein powder to up my protein intake. I have not had any increases in acne while eating the yogurt so I assume I will do ok with the protein as well. ,3,3,0
I've never tried goat dairy products, I know that I am also lactose intolerant the only thing I can eat without issues is Kraft Cheese or any popular name brand cheese that's highly processed.

If I eat high quality cheese I will break out and my stomach will be in shambles. makes you wonder how terrible these processed foods are for your body if my body doesn't react to it like real milk made products.,2,2,0
Hello, just a bit of wisdom on this. I'm vegan, and have been for 2.5 years, so I don't consume any dairy. I have had clear skin as a vegan, and my skin has gotten really, really bad. I don't think it's always correlated to diet, but I definitely think it is in some people! Worth a shot, plus it's healthier to give up dairy! But just know it might not help. I had an ex who followed the strictest diet ever (also vegan), and consumed hardly any fats, and still had bad acne. It's super individualized, but like I said it's worth a shot,2,2,0
From my understanding, it's the A1 casein protein in dairy that triggers acne, and I've found that to be true for myself. A1 casein is actually unique to Holstein cows, which unfortunately are the cow of choice for the vast majority of dairy companies (because they yield more milk than other cows and are therefore more profitable). Goat dairy does not have the A1 protein, and I've eaten that after months of swearing off of milk and cheese (and seeing my skin clear up) and my skin did not react, so theoretically it should be totally fine.

COINCIDENTALLY, I've been on the hunt for Jersey cow milk and cheese (as they don't produce A1 protein) for the last 8 months, and I haven't found it until literally just yesterday! It's called "a2 milk" and they're selling it at Sprouts, and I drank some yesterday and woke up with perfectly smooth skin and holy shit I'm excited about this new find.

Really good article that explains the link between dairy and acne:

ACNE IS NOT CAUSED BY DIET. There is no evidence to suggest this but one article that suggests a WEAK link. In fact, it's been debunked numerous times. Your dermatologists who are experts have spent years studying the skin will tell you the same thing. Placebo effect is real. So is confirmation bias.

Vitamin C! Ideally an oil that you can use as a substitute for lotion or crush uo vit c tablets and mix into a basic lotion (i recommend cetaphil).
The vit c helps repair collagen fibers and restore elastin which gives the skin the springiness and pigment back. Alternatively, drink 1T of apple cider vinegar mixed into water once daily, which helps balance the acidity of your digestive system. Or use it topically mixed with water, stored in thr fridge, as an evening toner over the spots. You can also look into purchasing a retinol or AHA cream for spot treatment, which helps fade scars.
Can also look into a product like Banish Acne Scars which I use. They go over the very basic science of usinh your body's own tools to help repair itself. 

The skin regenerates once every two weeks so you wouldn't see a change or difference until then. Depending on the age and depth of the redness, the new and lighter ones can take two weeks to fade, while older ones can take up to 6mos, and that's with a regular regiment and care of the skin. 

I don't recommend any drugs or antibiotics as that can fuck things up worse for the future, even if it works quickly and for the present. 

Good luck!,4,4,0

Microneedling for sure!! You can check out a brand called Banish to see how it works, then buy a microneedling thingy through ebay much much cheaper. Vit C serum is great combined with the treatment.

Thank you for your post. I would like to make a comment and also ask a question. 

When you said you use retinol? In what form or which product do you use? 

My comment is on diet and acne. 

Since I was 21 I have had acne. Not terrible but consistent. Since college when I was around 24, I was EXTREMELY healthy I ran 3-5 miles every single day and had the healthiest eating habits imaginable. It did not in any way whatsoever improve my acne. So I just want to let others know that im not so sure how much of an impact diet really does have on acne bc at my healthiest, I saw no improvement. Im pretty sure that mine is hormonal though. I have also tried everything and the only thing that seemed to work was spirolactone. HOWEVER,  the side effects were pretty bad so I stopped it even though my skin was glowing. ,8,8,0
Exactly my thoughts, though I often get downvoted when I try to recommend a diet change, so I don‚Äôt even bother anymore...,10,10,0
This is a great post. I too have suffered from acne for a long time. Tried all over the counter products, birth control pills etc. but nothing worked! I then discovered that it's because of my diet, so I eliminate dairy, sugar and mainly fatty foods. I even stopped from eating out, I cook my own meals and watch over my diet carefully. To my surprise my skin went from worst to getting clear! As to the products I use, I stopped using comedogenic products, I stopped using makeups for a while too. As of now, I follow the 8 step korean skincare that helped my scarring as well. Also, before I buy products for my face I always check the ingredients on cosdna.com so I would know if there's harmful ingredients on that certain product.


Edit: Retinol, niacinamide, AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, 100% Organic Cold-Pressed
Rose Hip Seed Oil are the products that I use recently from the ordinary brand, they've been doing well for my skin. I don't use all of them all at once, of course I should alternate them. 
As for my daily skincare routine I'll just insert a picture. :)

Glad to hear a similar story. I'm also 25 and I find that I break out when I eat certain foods. For me, its a few days after drinking regular milk or eating junk food, especially chocolate or chips or candy, but my skin is a lot better than in my teens. 

I'm ever thankful to my pediatrician telling me on my last visit with her about retin-a and her own uasge of it (she was late 50s and looking about early forties) for both acne and anti aging. She also let me know that Mexico sells it otc for real cheap so it was a lifesaver when I didn't have health insurance. I never forgot her tip about religious sunscreen so I hate when I'm caught outside without sunscreen. I always make sure I keep a couple in my car, at home, in my backpack.

I eat very clean (bodybuilder staple foods) and I still have acne.
I started taking some omega 3 pills and supplementing with zinc lately. Seems to work well but after my periods I broke out again --" (but had no acne before and during my periods...)
Maybe I should stop soy for a month. It's true that I still eat it even though I stopped meat.

Do you moisturise your skin daily with coconut oil ?
I feel like my cleanser makes my skin dry. I'll go back to micellar water I think. Seems to be the only thing that works fine for cleansing,1,1,0
what oils do you recommend? I have heard goods thing about vitamin c , castor and rose hip oil. so desperate I've tried it all. I just got my hands on some retinol serum though. So I'm doing my best to be consistent with one at a time to actually see what works. ,1,1,0

I use Make Up Forever‚Äôs Ultra HD Invisible Cover foundation. It‚Äôs pricey, about $40 a bottle but worth it. It doesn‚Äôt make me break out, doesn‚Äôt go on cakey over acne, is buildable, and the bottle usually lasts me about 2 months. 

I follow this up w some power Maybelline Shine Free Powder, just a light dusting to set the liquid foundation. This is drug store status and about $5-6 

And apply w a makeup sponge! I buy a big package of the single use ones, it‚Äôs more hygienic for acne prone skin and really helps blend in the foundation for perfect coverage (or at least as perfect as you could get w acne!),2,2,0
I‚Äôve previously used Bare minerals, but switched to Everyday Minerals due to the cost and research comparing their ingredients. EDM also has a buy two-get-one free kit and a much wider range of base colors based on cool, neutral, or warmer tones.
I did some googling to find the differences in ingredients:
The main differences are Bare‚Äôs two ingredients titanium dioxide and bismuth oxychloride. Bismuth oxychloride being a synthetic that‚Äôs potentially a skin irritant and suspected to cause cystic acne. Titanium dioxide being used for its spf qualities but a potential carcinogen. So EDM is lacking sunscreen, but doesn‚Äôt have the iffy stuff listed above.
The only downside I‚Äôve found is that Bare seems to cover a bit more, possibly due to bismuth oxychloride. But I‚Äôve been fine with using EDM‚Äôs ivory neutral with a makeup mist to keep it staying put.
Good luck!,2,2,0
I used to use Almay! They have a whole blemish line with Salicylic acid. Looks natural, but they have limited colors,2,2,0
ELF do an 'acne' foundation that is meant to help your skin whilst it's on.. however all the shades are very dark, I'm using the palest one and it's still way too orange for me, it's only worth using if you have tan skin. 
Rimmel do a transparent 'clear complexion' setting powder, NYX have a tea tree skin clearing primer.. you have to hunt around as different brands do different things. 
I've heard BareMinerals products are all natural and good for skincare, but it's pretty  expensive. ,1,1,0
BareMinerals (Bare pro liquid), Clinique (beyond perfecting), Loreal (pro Matte), Maybelline (Fit Me) are found were good on my acne prone skin. For setting powder I liked n7 perfect light loose setting powder. I found not completely removing makeup at the end of the day is what causes acne most, so be sure to remove everything off at night. ,1,1,0
My holy grail foundation for my acne prone skin is physicians formula mineral powder. The power is relatively full coverage and looks very natural. The only thing is that they definitely don‚Äôt have the best color selection and extremely limited for darker skin tones. Other than that I love it! Really fast to apply and has SPF 16 in it too. ,1,1,0
Here's what I've learnt. Caveman regimen *only* works for those who have been using comedogenic/irritating products in the past frequently. It works because your skin can actually heal on its own without any of those products putting your skin on overdrive and causing excess sebum production. 

If your routine is gentle to begin with, there's no reason to go on the caveman regimen. But if your products are shady, caveman regimen is a LOT better than using irritating products.,4,4,0

No joke, my skin looked like this in July. I lost my mind over it and finally went to see a derm. I followed the prescribed regimen and now my skin is clear and my red marks are fading nicely. Here‚Äôs what I did:

- spironolactone 
- BC since I wasn‚Äôt on it already
- retin-A and then switched tazorac (PM)
- finacea (AM)
- ren clearcalm moisturizer and face wash

Go see a derm. Almost all the things I changed required a prescription.,1,1,0

You could always try a homemade acne mask. You can then control the ingredients ensuring you only use good quality, natural stuff that doesn't irritate the skin or make things worse.

Some of these might be worth a shot. You can do them yourself...

I used clundamycin in the form of a gel with BP called duac. It worked for about a yr and a half then stopped. Now I'm on oral antibiotics called lymecycline ,1,1,0

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre treated like that. I had a similar experience with a dermatologist regarding laser therapy for scars. She said almost the exact same thing. She also made a comment that my forehead won‚Äôt see much improvement.. I was like, ‚ÄúGee, thanks..‚Äù I‚Äôm also 29, mind you. It felt very dismissive and bitchy.
Anyways, I would look into another dermatologist if possible. Websites like RealSelf help with reviews, I would also see about putting your experience with that derm on there as well.
I think that‚Äôs why many of us develop body dysmorphia, because we feel very alone in our fight to feel better.
But to answer your question, yes, it‚Äôll get worse before it gets better. You should moisturize. It‚Äôs your skin purging itself. 
I know for me, it helped to use retin-a with AHA‚Äôs and BHA‚Äôs. I was put on an antibiotic and it helped, but moved onto spirolactone, which helps manage my new breakouts.  
We‚Äôre here for you here. You don‚Äôt have to put up with a derm who doesn‚Äôt make the time for her clients. ,2,2,0
As soon as your Dermatologist said it's not even that bad, I would have walked out, that's very unprofessional, you're there to receive a service and sounds like she's providing a shit job at that. Not asking about your current skincare routine should be the bare minimum if nothing else.,2,2,0
I watched a video where a dermatologist said that derma rolling at home isn‚Äôt really safe because those needles need to be sterile since they are opening the skin and it‚Äôs such a hard instrument to clean at home so it‚Äôs better to get that done professionally or skip it all together. ,3,3,0
Tumeric + honey + apple cidear. Leave it on your face as long as u would like. The ONLY thing to help my scars. I still breakout and what not but this mask is what helps my skin heal and my scars. ,3,3,0
Does your toothpaste have SLS in it? It‚Äôs a fairly common ingredient in toothpastes and can cause closed comedones/acne around the mouth/chin in some people.,2,2,0
Are you male or female ,1,1,0
I've always had my acne round my mouth and the only thing that cleared it us has been antibiotics (lymecycline specifically). Honestly if nothing OTC seems to be working the best thing is to go and see a dr ,1,1,0
You might want to try a new toothpaste and see if that makes any difference. I had horrifically chapped lips and acne around my mouth, and it was due to a sensitivity to whitening ingredients. I switched to a toothpaste that doesn't whiten and doesn't have SLS, and the problem cleared up. 

Also, it's very possible that the combination of the face wash, high BP, and prescription gel is too harsh and causing irritation to your skin which worsens the acne, especially if you're not applying any type of moisturizer. When your skin becomes too parched it can actually cause more oil to be produced in an effort to compensate. If you haven't already done so, you might want to check out the "regimen" on Acne.org. The advice given there for using a gentle face wash, a good moisturizer, and a BP of 2% is what many dermatologists have also recommended. If you want to use your prescription gel, I'd just use that alone rather than along with the salicylic acid and the BP 10%.

First off, I know how difficult it feels to see yourself as attractive because of these crazy cysts and whiteheads that never seem to go away. You said you go out with someone? This girl obviously sees something in you other than your acne, she likes you and your company, she wouldn‚Äôt keep going out with you if she didn‚Äôt. I never had bad acne in high school,  but now at the age of 27, I have been dealing with adult onset acne since I was 23. Similar to you, I tried everything. I mean everything, I didn‚Äôt want to start accutane (my brother had to stop because of suicidal thoughts.) I do get self conscious at times but I tell myself it‚Äôs temporary and it will be worth it to not fight my skin in my 30s.

Second, head over to r/Accutane and read up about isotretinoin and managing it. It‚Äôs no joke. You have to make sure your lifestyle will be compatible with taking the drug for 6-12 months of your life. Educate yourself on how to manage your body and the dryness. Washing your face multiple times a day will actually make your skin worse, accutane thins it out and makes it very sensitive - washing once in the morning and at night is generally all you need. Everyone‚Äôs body reacts differently but I find that I have less of a hard time with the dryness if I stay hydrated (which I do to begin with living at high altitude) and taking my pill with meals.

Your dermatologist will most likely start you with a loading dose for the first month, which is usually half of what your therapeutic dose is. You will need to get lab work to monitor your liver and cholesterol levels and your derm will manage it accordingly. Most people go through something called the ‚Äòinitial breakout‚Äô (IB). It‚Äôs basically your skin purging all the nasties already in your pores. My IB lasted a week and a half with my loading dose and since I‚Äôve been put on my actual dose, the second burst of breakouts have almost gone away.

All good things take time. Keep your chin up. Remember that your self consciousness about yourself is only made out as bad as you allow it.,3,3,0
After accutane, I feel like I could slather lard on my face and it'd be fine. But the acne came back after 6ish months :( The dryness, tho, sticks around even afterwards so moisturize! ,2,2,0
important for not pregnant please,1,1,0
Accutane did not work for me. It made me suicidal. Please be aware of the risks. Your skin will get worse before it gets better, if at all. Only use it as a last resort - and I don‚Äôt mean after trying a bunch of other pills and chemicals, but after experimenting with your diet and cleansing methods! Please, t is not a drug to trifle with!,1,1,0

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs changed much in the past 14 years, but be aware that it will get worse before it gets better. Whatever you do, PLEASE check in with someone about your moods and any depressive or suicidal feelings you may have - that is what I experienced on Accutane and I know that is one of the major side effects (besides scary pregnant ladies lol). It didn‚Äôt work for me but I hope it works for you! Your skin must be bad if you‚Äôre trying this... good luck!!,2,2,0

For me, the first two weeks were kinda sucky (purging) and after that, a thick layer of aquaphor on my face at all times and some oatmeal baths made everything pretty bearable!

Oh man after years of bad acne a single course of Accutane made my skin perfect for a very long time.  

It‚Äôs so worth it!,1,1,0
Whatever you do, don‚Äôt drink alcohol while taking it. I developed fatty liver this way. It‚Äôs very hard on your body. 
Also, like someone else mentioned can cause mood swings. I had severe anxiety that  kicked in after I stopped taking it. I think because the depression wore off. 
Good luck! ,1,1,0
This is something you can over come. Don‚Äôt let it get the best of you. I know it hurts your self esteem but your acne doesn‚Äôt define you. Have you seen a doctor/ dermatologist? This is the best thing you could do. They can explore all options of treatment with you and give you a starting place. Even if you don‚Äôt want to be treated by the doctor they could give you an idea of products or ingredients to look for in your skin care.,2,2,0
I'm 15 too and I promise, my scarring is--lets just say--much much worse. Mostly on my cheeks and my forehead. Get cysts occasionally on my forehead.,2,2,0
Your routine seems well put together imo. Make sure you only exfoliate as often as the packaging suggests, as excessive exfoliating could irritate the skin.,1,1,0
Okay your skin looks and sounds similar to mine so I‚Äôm going to tell you what has and has not worked for me, but every body is different. Since age 12 (I‚Äôm 25 now) I‚Äôve been fighting it and only in the last 2-3 years have conquered chronic, debilitating acne.

I went through all sorts of medications, oral (even Accutane) and topological (prescribed and over the counter, BP and SA) and NOTHING WORKED. All the chemical-laden exfoliants and benzoyl peroxide you‚Äôre using - it keeps your skin in a constant state of emergency and it‚Äôs producing more sebum to overcompensate. Commercial moisturizers won‚Äôt help. Trust me, I piled so much of that crap on throughout my teen years and all I got for it was worse acne scars. And those are much harder to get rid of.

So my advice would be to STOP with all that. Your skin is the most delicate organ on your body. The chemicals are hurting it. (Plus, if the cosmetics industry cures your acne then how will they continue to make money off of you?)

What has (finally!) worked for me: changes to my eating habits, oil cleansing, and retinol. That‚Äôs it.

I noticed that you didn‚Äôt mention your diet at all. I ignored mine too, until recently. I used an elimination diet (specifically Alejandro Junger‚Äôs Clean - I read the book but there are also free PDFs online; however, knowledge is power and you‚Äôll more likely succeed if you understand the reasoning; and I didn‚Äôt bother with all the supplements and crap they try to sell you, the info is all you need). In an elimination diet you eliminate all potential allergens/triggers until your body eliminates them completely from your system, then you slowly add them back in one by one and notice how your body responds. I experienced multiple benefits but I paid special attention to my acne. I kept neurotically detailed notes and figured out that, for me, dairy, soy, and alcohol all made me break out. For you it will probably be different but honestly this made the biggest and best difference both to my skin and my overall health and sense of well-being. That being said, I know it‚Äôs the toughest change to make. You‚Äôve already made an excellent change by drinking more water though!! So obviously you have the willpower. 

So the other change I made was oil cleansing, which I started a year before experimenting with my diet. I know it might sound crazy if you‚Äôre not hip to natural methods, but [here‚Äôs an article that explains how it works](https://crunchybetty.com/oil-cleansing-method/) . Since our skin types seem similar, I‚Äôm just telling you what worked for me. With oily skin, we need to tell our bodies to STOP overproducing oil - but drying it out with chemical-laden ‚Äúmoisturizers‚Äù just tells your body you need more oil. So instead you need to add good oil to your skin so it will take note and stop clogging your pores. I experimented with different oils in the beginning but settled on coconut oil. It‚Äôs antibacterial, antifungal, smells good, and it‚Äôs cleansing and moisturizing in one step. I used to do it morning and night but find I don‚Äôt even need to in the morning anymore. 

Retinol (just straight vitamin A, one of the few vitamins humans can absorb topically) is commonly used for anti-aging, but the principle worked for my acne and acne scars too. It has really faded my scars over time. Basically it increases skin cell turnover. I apply it at night, after oil cleansing. It helps prevent new acne, erase old scars, and prevents signs of aging! Not that you or I have to worry about that yet, but it‚Äôs a great bonus. Again, I stick to the natural stuff. 

Other than those things, I exfoliate once or twice a week using a natural exfoliating facial sponge I picked up at Wal Mart. (Specifically, Ecotools facial mask sponges and no, I‚Äôm not being paid!) When I use that I use Vichy Normaderm cleanser. It is the only non-organic soap product I use because it‚Äôs the only one that ever worked for me, but it‚Äôs pretty expensive and I find it‚Äôs too harsh to use too often. (Vichy used to have a three-item pack with the cleanser, a mask, and a toner which all worked wonders for me, but they seem to have discontinued it.) I just use the cleanser once or twice a week now when I exfoliate - but I put coconut oil on my face immediately after.

I should also mention that it could be hormonal. I‚Äôm a woman so we‚Äôll certainly be different in that aspect, but men have cyclic hormonal fluctuations too. Keeping track of when you break out will be extremely helpful. Because of my acne I‚Äôve been on birth control since I was 12, but the acne continued to be horrific anyway so I don‚Äôt think it had much effect. I will say though that now if I do break out at all it‚Äôs around the time of my period, but I can prevent it if I stay on top of my diet and routine.

I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going through this. It sounds so superficial but it‚Äôs really hard, especially when you‚Äôre young and going to school every day. I really regret abusing my skin like I did and I know I sound like a hippie with all my natural remedies, but honestly that‚Äôs just what works for me. I hope it works for you too. 

Just remember to treat your skin - and yourself! - kindly.

My dad used to tell me I need to get help with my face and that it wasn‚Äôt attractive. He would also point out my stretch marks and say they were ugly. My acne wasn‚Äôt even that bad and he always said stuff about it. He didn‚Äôt offer to take me to a dermatologist or buy my skin care to help it  but he was happy to offer hurtful words every day. I have since cut him out of my life for causing me so much body hatred in my teens. ,13,13,0
Thankfully people have said that they don't notice it or it doesn't look that bad. But sometimes just lying about it hurts like I know people notice it so I'd rather them say oh yeah looks sore than oh it's not bad! If that makes sense. 

But your mum is being real nasty. She must be embarrassed? Thats what I'm getting from this and that's so pathetic. I feel like she had a go at you because you called her out and she knows deep down that she's upsetting you but she'd rather keep doing that than stop apologising for the way your skin looks to other people. That's sad and way uglier than having acne. It's common, it happens just look after yourself mentally and remember your mum is only highlighting her ugliness inside and trying to push that onto you by easily pointing out your physical insecurities. I don't want to shit talk your mum because she's your mum but she's being a twat.  ,5,5,0
I used to be harassed for having acne during my early high school years. I tried wearing make-up, but that‚Äôd lead to harassing either way. It was a never-ending cycle until I decided to just focus on taking care of myself and know I‚Äôm doing my best for my skin. To this day, my skin is riddled with acne scars.

And I know you‚Äôre doing your best for your skin too. And I just want to remind you that you are not defined by your looks, and your mother is being quite shallow and perhaps just doesn‚Äôt understand what to do. I, and also the community here too, understand how tiring it feels to have something we never asked for. And that her words and people‚Äôs judgements are a bitch and hit you really low. But please know you‚Äôre not alone - we‚Äôre here for you. We understand and support you. You‚Äôll make it through this. :),4,4,0
The thing you have to make yourself understand is that your looks do not define you. Acne? Doesn‚Äôt matter. Stretch marks? Doesn‚Äôt matter. Birthmarks? Doesn‚Äôt matter. You are made up of how you treat other people and your behaviors in everyday situations. Appearances change and are irrelevant in the long run. People will always remember how you treated them. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs matters. ,2,2,0
Hey, I think what you‚Äôre lacking is moisture. It seems you‚Äôre over-washing your face (2 times at most!). You should invest in a gentle toner and moisturizer. Your skin is probably oily due to the dryness of your skin, and is trying to rehydrate it.
A common misconception is that if your face is oily, you don‚Äôt need a moisturizer, when the otherwise is true. You NEED a moisturizer because your face is oily.,4,4,0

the acne itself, you gotta wait for it to go away.

for the dark spots, buy a derma roller or a derma stamp.

its cheap and extremely effective. but make sure your acne is not active when you use it or it will get worse.

 bonus, wash your face with kojic acid soap. 

do some research and check it out on youtube

Do you wet the towel or use it dry?,1,1,0
You‚Äôre more sensitive to the sun when taking tetracycline. Make sure to wear sunscreen everyday. Vanicream sunscreen is a good choice. If you can‚Äôt find it in a store you can purchase it on Amazon. It‚Äôs also important to moisturize. Give the medication time to work. Don‚Äôt give up. I‚Äôve been there. Good luck to you! ,2,2,0
Why are you trying to quit it? I'm a big believer in 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. If it's working then just keep using it. For me, benzoyl peroxide made my skin very dry though so I understand if it's the same for you.

Instead, maybe use it a spot treatment for any acne that pops up on your face? It's the best of both worlds, you'll tackle specific acne while keeping your face happy. ,5,5,0
I, like you, used BP on and off but only for a few months (I was prescribed Epiduo which also contains Adapalene). The burning sensation and the dryness made me believe that the treatment was effective, but every time I applied the BP, a cystic pimple would form somewhere on my forehead. I would get at least two every week. After quitting, I noticed that the cystic pimples stopped forming, but I had ridiculous amounts of white heads and papules. If you've been using the BP for over 2-3 years, I recommend gradually withdrawing--not so sudden. BP definitely also causes skin to become more scar prone but less sensitive since it is sort of callousing your skin. Good luck! Also, what concentration is your BP treatment: 3%, 10% etc.?,2,2,0

Listen to the professionals. Who knows if those random people even wash their face, or have ever even taken the drug. My skin didn't get worse when my doxy cycle  ended, but I was still using retin-a. ,3,3,0
I believed doxy helped me when i was on it. But came back after but i didnt take care of my skin either, as in change my diet and what not. Took it three times. I would say it helped me while i was taking it. Going to start accutane on Wednesday! 

I think it just depends on the person. I know one girl who took it and it cleared her up with the help of topicals too. I dont think mines got worse on it. Just try it out and if it doesnt work you should look into accutane. I just wish i did accutane before instead of taking antibiotics three times doing harm to my gut. Make sure you finish your whole course and try eating some fermated foods, drinking kombucha, or look into probiotics to get some good bacteria back in your body! Oh and taper off the pill!,3,3,0
Idk if it'll come back worse but it'll definitely come back ,1,1,0
Good luck with it. I had a lot of problems with doxy and right now my skin is just awful. Idk if I got follicular is from the tetracycline antibiotics I was prescribed but I got off mino and doxy Cus they didn't help at all. ,1,1,0
I had awful diarrhea while on Doxycycline and my acne became worse. It might work for you, you just have to try out first,1,1,0

I prefer to dry out my hormonal jawline acne. I use BP and Cosrx A-Sol to dry them out. I do use moisturizer after. ,3,3,0
Yes. Tea tree oil. Only use it in spots, not on your whole face! If you do want to use thin your whole face, mix it with aloe vera or coconut oil.,2,2,0
Try not to cleanse when you get home , as it can over dry your skin which can cause acne, just wet it with water or use a toner. ,2,2,0
I'd rate it a 9! I cleansed 3 times a day just like you because my skin after school would look like it could definitely use some cleansing. But, to avoid drying out your skin, I'd recommend using a very mild cleanser after school such as cleansing wipes, a cleansing toner or micellar water to replace your cleansing routine after school. Personally, I'd use the most moisturising products towards the end of the day before sleeping and in turn the most "oil-stripping"/"drying" cleansers formulated for oily skin at the beginning of the day before school :) ,1,1,0
What are you planning on eating to bulk up? Too much sugar, milk and whey protein will all mess up your skin.

Eggs, meat and veggies and complex carbs like sweet potato and brown rice shouldn't be an issue. ,6,6,0
Honestly to my understanding most foods like too much sugar or oil for example will not cause acne. What causes it is eating or eating too much of a food you‚Äôre actually allergic to (ie like dairy). Sometimes you can be mildly allergic and get away with that food every once in a while but once you start eating it every day (whole milk for example) it can cause problems.

If you‚Äôre allergic to any foods and eat it often like when bulking you will surely notice. I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much tbh, you‚Äôll just have to see what happens.,2,2,0
Idk my back acne has cleared up sooooooo muchhhhh in the course of 6 months. So what I first did was use the Neutrogena salicylic acid wash (yellow) in the shower. And I would use a black charcoal exfoliator everyday(  i know terrible) . Then I would use coconut oil after I got off and then apply tea tree oil. My chest and back looked so much better the next day!!! So ive did that for a month, I still had a lot of acne but it looked better. Then after that Ive stopped using the coconut oil, and started using Alpha skincare body renewal lotion with glycoloic acid then applied tea tree oil and ive used that for like 2-3 months. After tht most of my acne was gone and I would just wash my body and sometimes apply my clay mask on my chest/back. Right now my acne has cleared up 90% and im left with a huge acne scar (it was there for like 2 years) and just discoloration. I hope this helps. Sometimes I would jist aplly tee tree oil on my body . Tee tree oil doenst hurt/burn on my chest/back because the skin on your body is more thicker and all I feel is a cooling minty sensation. It feels amazing and the only bad thing is that it makes u smell like an old lady lol 
Edit: also, when I wash my hair I try to make sure none of the shampoo touches my face/ body. So I bend over in the shower ahaha . Also Ive been chaning the shirt I sleep in everyday,1,1,0
Dr. Bronner‚Äôs fixed my body acne. It‚Äôs not harsh for me, but you don‚Äôt need a lot of it, just use t with water like you would any other body wash. I used the one with tea tree oil and it worked wonders.

I also stopped sleeping in t-shirts and switched to low-cut tank tops. I found that was really irritating and causing me to break out on my chest and shoulders/back.,1,1,0
When my skin was dry and flaky due to acne treatment, I turned to coconut oil. I would slather it all over my face and rub it in really well before a shower and let it kind of soak in so I could rub off flakes. Then at night, after using cerave hydrating (not foaming!) facewash, I'd use more coconut oil.  I'd put cerave pm lotion over it to sort of seal it in or use the cerave night cream. Coconut oil saved my skin though. And drinking tons of water. Never made me break out more, soothed all the irritation and eradicated my flakes for good. I hope you find what works for you!,3,3,0

Hi guys, so I'm 18 years old and I have acne as is shown in the picture on both my cheeks. I've always thought that as I'm a teenager and I don't squeeze or pop spots that my acne would clear up in the next few years. 

However, someone has said to me that I should get my "acne scars treated" so now I'm worried that I have acne scars. I thought I'd come to this subreddit to see if that's the case.

So do I have acne scars or just regular acne that will clear up?

Thanks for your help!,1,1,0
Most likely but not alot some only,1,1,0
Definately some PiH, coloration that will fade in time after the acne is gone. I'm not seeing many, if any, indent/icepick scars but its difficult to tell with this photo. ,1,1,0
Your coloration will fade, I suggest trying glycolic acid and/or vitamin C. I'm not seeing indentations, do you pick at them?,1,1,0
Similar to mine. Acne scars and hyper pigmentation are different. I believe you just have hyper pigmentation. Scarring, from my understanding, comes in 4 forms: ice pick, rolling, atrophic , and boxcar. From the photo alone, it doesn‚Äôt seem like you have any of those. Just some redness that‚Äôll go away in weeks or a couple of months. ,1,1,0

Hi! I am F16 too and doxy is working for me (only on the T zone) but I don't think you will need it :) talk to a dermatologist though, you need a doctor's consent for that drug.,1,1,0
Where?!,1,1,0
Maybe you can try cutting out everything with sugar and milk from your diet for a few days? Just to see whether it plays a role. 
Drinking peppermint tea is supposed to help with hormonal acne - can't go wrong with that as well. 

I also noticed you use BHA and BP without any sun protection. That might cause hyperpigmentation. 
When your skin is sensitive, it might also break out more often.

I hope your breakouts go away very soon! ,7,7,0
Have you tried any diet changes? What worked for me was juicing lots of veggies every day. I juice everyday: 4 cucumbers, 4 sticks of carrots, one apple, and half a lemon. It takes a few months to see results but this is what got me much clearer. I am also on a very clean vegan diet. ,6,6,0
My first thought, since one side of your face is worse than the other, is that your pillowcase is causing some issues if you tend to sleep on that side. Change your pillowcase often and consider the laundry detergent might be irritating your face too.  

My second thought, if your konjac sponge is two months old it needs to be replaced. They do hold on to bacteria, even if you rinse and dry them well after each use.

Third, the Burt's Bees has coconut oil in it, some people are sensitive to that ingredient. There are also all kinds of extracts and herbal ingredients in that moisturizer, which I'm wary of. Sometimes companies put stuff in their products that sound cool and exotic, but don't really help and may actually be irritating. Try something bland and proven to do the job of moisturizing well, Cerave comes to mind.

I get acne monthly no matter my routine. I‚Äôve gone to several dermatologist and have been offered a series of harsh medicines and treatments. Some of which I‚Äôve had to refuse because they can be harmful if you want to have kids or get pregnant. I‚Äôve also made drastic lifestyle and diet changes, just for them not to work. Anyway, my answer isn‚Äôt so much a suggestion so much as it is for moral support. I am 31 and have had acne since I was 13. That‚Äôs more than half of my life. I tend to get one or two cystic zits per month. They hurt and take two-three weeks to go away. It‚Äôs been horrible and it never seems to get better no matter what I try. The only time I didn‚Äôt get acne was when I was pregnant. Best 9 months of my life. For most, pregnancy is when they break out. But for me it was opposite. Isn‚Äôt that strange? Outside of that I‚Äôve tried everything that I can besides major options the doctors have offered that they don‚Äôt recommend for people in child rearing years. I just want to say that you are not alone and that it does suck. You have every right to be bummed out about it. Friends and family will recommend things just for you to try them and not work. So my advice is to not let your expectations that this might go away someday get in the way of you being able to cope with the reality that this is a part of who you are. And it sucks. And it‚Äôs okay to complain about it to those who understand. It may not be your fault or anything your doing. For me I know it‚Äôs hormonal so sometimes acne just is apart of who we are. Most people just learn a few ways to minimize outbreaks but there is no cure. So please don‚Äôt beat yourself up. You didn‚Äôt ask for this but your not alone. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt give you better tangible tips for actual treatment. I just find that acne is so individual that if you keep trying things you‚Äôll find at least a regime that works best for you. Even though it will not cure your acne, it will manage it better. Best of luck! ,4,4,0
I have a similar skin story. Where your acne is located and the fact that it looks like cysts makes think yours is also hormonal (like mine). 

Did you recently start or stop hormonal birth control?  That can really aggravate it, but skin often changes for the worst in the 30s because of lowering estrogen levels. 

Some things that have helped me: 


1. Spearmint tea (at least two cups daily of it brewed really strong) to lower androgen levels. 

2. Olly‚Äôs undeniable beauty vitamins. I think it is mostly the borage oil because it helps with hormonal issues and soothes the skin. 

3. Zinc. I take pills (some forms sre more effective than others), but you could try to incorporate more zinc-rich foods. It also makes skin less oily. 

4. An oil-free mattifier. I use OC-8, but will sometimes use Milk of Magnesia under make up or at night when my skin is particilarly hellish. Both make a difference if I start or stop within days, 

5. Queen Helene‚Äôs Mint Julep Mask. This also makes a real difference. It‚Äôs better than Proactive‚Äôs sulfur mask and so cheap too!

6. Neutrogena ClearSkin Foundation. I know you said you don‚Äôt usually wear make up, but this won‚Äôt clog pores, is cheap, and covers really well. It always helps my self-esteem to wear it when my skin is bad. 

Good luck! I hope you find something that helps. Feel free to ask any questions you may have. We 30 year old women with acne have to stick together!,2,2,0
Have you tried going to Planned Parenthood for BCP? That really helped me when I was poor b/c they have a sliding scale and the pills were really affordable. 
Some BCP work better than others. For me ortho tricyclin was great for my skin, but the side effects were too strong. Then I was on desogyn for years and had no problems. I went off BCP when I was 35 and acne cane back until I started eating a very clean diet. I also take an herbal supplement called DIM that cleared up almost all of my acne except for a few small ones. 
I can‚Äôt eat a lot of sugar or carbs tho or it starts coming back again. 
Good luck. ,1,1,0
Go to a dermatologist. Let us know how it goes.,1,1,0

I don't use any products on my face but diet and nutrition worked for me. No dairy, low sugar and carb and a Zinc supplement (30mg) has stopped the cystic acne along my jawline. ,1,1,0
Your picture is really dark, but it looks like melasma.  PCA Skin makes some pigment gel that's worked well for me, combined with chemical peels every 3 months or so. ,1,1,0
Ive had fairly bad acne from the age of 11 to now-17 with coverage of most of my face, neck,chest and back. Ive also been on prescribed meds with little success. I havent taken acutane though because of the potential side affects

I started to develop huge cysts on my neck this year putting my skin in its worst condition ever.
Kinda made me hate everything.

3 weeks ago I started a vitamin supplement routine off a reccomendation to try and fix my skin and its been working really well.
My acne is hormonal btw.

My cheeks are clearing and the cysts on my neck are mostly gone( i still have spots but theres a noticeable difference even in the pigmentation of my skin) My chest and back have 75% cleared.
I noticed the effects within the first 4-5 days

Ive been taking:
-Magnesium supplements
-Calcium supplements 
-Vitamin k supplements
-Omega 3 suppl.
-VITAMIN D3 suppl. (this one in my opinion is vital-its essentialy the good stuff the sun gives you...or at least thats my understanding. You might notice your skin get better if your on holidays in a really sunny country?- its because of this vit)
-I also take a multivitamin.
--I take these once daily--

As for creams and masks I take 
-Differin(prescribed) Im not sure if it works or not to be honest its just like extra reassurance.
-Charcoal masks and shower creams.

Also Ive changed up my diet slightly- avoiding sugars and dairy if possible-I think pastas are also meant to be bad for skin.

I can post brands and dosages later if your interested. Obviously with acne one thing might work for some but not others so it mightnt work.(Its worth trying though imo)

Hope this helps

Honestly there's not much you can do for severe cystic acne besides Accutane. If you're a girl and it's hormonal Spiro might work,1,1,0
Sleep sleep sleep, wash top down, aloe Vera for face,1,1,0
I never had cystic acne as a teen & then it decided to start popping up at 30.  Totally sucks. I ended up going to an acne specialist (not a dermatologist) & it's been a little over a year now, but my skin is definitely the clearest it's ever been, & without oral meds.  It took a lot of product changes, some lifestyle changes & regular chemical peels, but I'm so happy with where my skin is now.  If there are any "Face Reality" certified aestheticians in your area I'd totally recommend going to one. ,1,1,0
If you‚Äôve been on lots of antibiotics you may be having gut imbalances that can cause all sorts of hormonal and skin imbalances. Google a bit about skin and sibo. Or also perioral dermatitis. When I treated my acne this way I had much better luck. Turns out harsh acne treatments can actually make this kind of acne worse, so it‚Äôs worth looking in to. Good luck. 
,1,1,0
Ever watch popping videos on YouTube? That really helped me. Also, hydrocholloid patches. Put one on a big spot and not only will it help heal, it covers it so you can't pick it.

/compulsiveskinpicking

Advice here helped me break the habit a lot :),1,1,0
I find it helpful to set myself rewards, like no picking for one day means I have a bubble bath. No picking for a week I get a burger out. etc.,1,1,0
I completely understand how frustrating it can be when you don't know what is causing your acne!! :( Which specific area of your face do you get the pustules?

The only 3 things I can suggest at the moment are
1.) your pillowcase... make sure you are sleeping on a fresh pillowcase every night. I know this may seem like a lot of effort but 1 pillowcase can be used twice (front and back) and I just keep a spare 3 next to my bed. This has helped hugely for me especially where I had acne on my cheeks.

2.) My skin reacted pretty badly to Simple. Yours might be fine if you only get acne in a certain place. I like to look at the ingredients on cosDNA.com 

3.) Pustules are inflammatory and mine went down considerably when I cut out dairy. If you search "Acne and dairy" on google the information is overwhelming! But there's no harm in trying for a couple of weeks?

Even though you prefer non invasive home care, the fact that you've struggled for so long with a single cyst is crazy. A steroid injection into the cyst will sort it out almost immediately and probably permanently. ,2,2,0
Try the steroid injection first; if it goes away, perfect, but it may simply shrink and come back. Do not get this injected too many times, it may cause a divot in the skin. 
This sounds like you have a sac that needs to be removed and will continue to fill until the entire body of the sac is removed. This is a very quick process at the derm. Best of luck.,1,1,0
Hydrocolloid bandages. They're also called blister bandages.

Clean your face, apply one to the pimple on your lip. It'll probably be gone by tomorrow. If it isn't gone, it will absolutely be significantly smaller. Good luck! :),5,5,0
Rather than popping it, which can make it worse if not cleaned properly, try drying it out overnight. Mix baking soda with water until it's a 'mush' then apply it directly to the spot. Leave it overnight. By morning the redness should be gone and it should be mostly dried out.,-2,-2,0
I used to have the same problem, until I ordered some product called ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äôs Secret‚Äù it‚Äôs by some brand called alaffia. It‚Äôs like 13 dollars I believe, but it works wonders! It comes in a small jar, which I was upset about at first but it turns out you only need a very small amount for your whole face. Like the amount I used is equivalent to the size of a lady-bug.


Anyways, the benefits of this product are quite...amazing. All natural ingredients, makes your skin incredibly soft, stops flaking, it even reduced the appearance of some scars I had and may even diminished some zits! Good luck!,2,2,0
I‚Äôm also on doxycycline and retin a. The best moisturizer I have found before bed (and in the morning after I wash my face) is clean and clear dual action moisturizer. I still get some dry skin sometimes falling off my face in the morning but with this stuff it‚Äôs much much less. Plus this moisturizer has salicylic acid in it, an added bonus! 


Question for you: how has your experience taking doxycycline been? I‚Äôm a month in and while I still break out they are no longer deep and painful, more on the surface which gives my topicals a chance to work. ,2,2,0
It looks like cystic acne. If it‚Äôs that kind, you‚Äôll feel them really deep in the skin and they never really come to a head. Have you seen a dermatologist? They can normally tell you if it‚Äôs hormonal and a direction on how to treat it.,1,1,0
Drink lots of water, try to not eat too much junk food (hot Cheetos, Doritos, soda, etc) or dairy. Drinking at least 4 water bottles per day helped me a lot ,7,7,0
You‚Äôll have to see a dermatologist for the cyst but for blackheads and whiteheads, oxy pads work really well! So does witch hazel. They‚Äôre both pretty cheap and can be found anywhere,4,4,0
Try epiduo. It's what I, a 29 year old female, use.

Edit: you can also find adapelene on Amazon for like $10 bucks. It's the generic version. It has SO helped me!,3,3,0
Go and see a derm ,2,2,0
What is your diet like, and what other products are you using?
Many people have success with the brand CosRx - it's inexpensive and potent. You'll find these products on Amazon. If you let me know how what your budget is (you can DM me if you prefer) I can be more specific about which products might help you in the product line. These will help some, but you also need internal factors as well. Lots of sunscreen and water, no products with alcohol or witch hazel.
In any case, I would not use a 10% benzoyl peroxide - this will cause dryness and flaking that can lead to more clogged pores and redness. I am currently using a 4% BP called PanOxyl. I am on hormonal prescription that is specific to women, unfortunately, but if you do go into the derm I would ask what the male equivalent to spironolactone is as opposed to going through the long struggle of antibiotics. If I go into mine anytime soon I will ask and get back to you. 
A derm may try a steroid injection for the cyst, just don't get it injected to many times. Otherwise, a removal is fairly quick as well.,1,1,0
Girls don‚Äôt care about that stuff. As long as you‚Äôre clean and smell good (and not a douche), they‚Äôll probably go out with you. 
Benzoyl peroxide works well for me. I use a 10% cleanser once a day and spot treat as needed. ,0,0,0
Some background- 

I've had acne since around 13 and it was bad like all over my face and swollen bad. Dermatologist tried everything in this order... BC, tricycline, doxycycline, retinae, some weird yellowish face wash pads with retinae after, then accutane THREE TIMES! The accurate worked each time but the acne came back a few months after each round. Not as bad but bad enough we did it again. It's not as bad as it used to be but after the third accurate round I figured I would just have to wait to grow out of it. 

Here I am, a fucking adult college graduate trying to do this adult thing yet I have acne like I'm a freshly pubescent teen. It's taking a toll on me both personally and professionally. I work in EMS where I work 24-72 hour shifts at a time and it's not an option to cover my face with makeup for that amount of time. Even if I could, you can obviously see I'm just covering it up so make up is pretty pointless. Now I'm advancing in my career and want to confidently proceed in life in general but I just want to wear a paper bag over my face. It's ridiculous. Maybe I'm vain but fuck it I'm vain and am over this. It's painful and uncomfortable

Now I will admit I do pick once in a while however I can manage not to and stop myself. However when I go long periods without picking it doesn't make a difference. 

I see people post on here progress and routines and i feel like everyone's finding a solution! I want to be one of those people but I don't know what those products you're listing do and why you use them. I've tried so many and they don't seem to make a difference. Any advice on routines, products and anything else is appreciated. 

Side note: currently on BC after being off for months. No difference in skin before or now, still bad,6,6,0
The four things that made the most difference for my skin:

1. reducing sugar/carbs in my diet - I eat a keto diet, no breads, candy, sodas, etc.

2. using a cleanser with a lower pH (~5.5) - lots of websites out there have lists of cleansers tested for pH. 

3. moisturizing the everloving bejeezus out of my skin, as opposed to trying to reduce my natural oils by using drying irritating treatments.

4. avoiding alcohols and fragrance in skincare - so many hidden irritants. I have been working on educating myself on chemical names, so now I always look at the ingredients list when I check out new products rather than relying on the claims that the company makes. 

,4,4,0
I havent found a solution after 5 years and two dermatologists, two shots at antibiotics which made a huge difference, but didn't work permanently. 

My acne isn't too persistent, but I don't want to use accutane because of health related problems, so I'm pretty much stuck playing around with products and diets.

I currently don't do sugar, dairy, and gluten. I take vitamin D and omega 6, and do a lot of excercise.,2,2,0

Hi, I'm 19 Male college student so I can relate to your situation! I'm actually at classes right now but wanted to let you know I've seen the post and will reply after classes this evening.

Just to keep in mind, all your worries are completely normal and basically the same as mine were. I'm 1.5 months in 80mg. Hold tight I'll get back to you soon :),1,1,0
although i'm a female the contacts situation could apply to either of us, accutane dries basically everything out, so anything from your lips, your hair, skin, and eyes will all feel a lot dryer than usual. I did my full course just fine with wearing contacts daily for usually 16hr days and just kept some rewetting drops on me with my chapstick at all times. It's really not bad at all. ,1,1,0
I was on Accutane for 8 months, it cleared up my skin AMAZINGLY. Honestly just go crazy with the moisturiser, Blistex and Vaseline are great for your lips, and for nose that is a good idea, I couldn't use lip salve like Carmex because it hurt. Also DON'T put any weird chemicals and shit on your skin, just stick to the Cetaphil regime and maybe Sudocrem if anything. 

RE affecting your ability to concentrate and moods, I went through major depression when I was on my course but I don't know if that was related to Accutane or not to be honest, it began when I went on it but I also had ADHD and other things affecting my ability to work. Just don't do what I did and lie to your dermatologist about your moods, because likelihood is they'll ask you about it at your checkups. I did because I thought that if I told them I was depressed they would take me off the regime and to 17 year old me that seemed like the worst possibility. Just don't do that basically, because they're only trying to help you.

Sorry didn't answer everything, I don't remember eating any differently whilst on my course, I (wasn't at the time) but am vegetarian and do notice I break out when I eat red meat, if that's something to consider? Myorisan is likely just another brand name for Accutane, as Accutane is a brand and the actual name for the medication is Isotretinoin.

Also, stick it out as long as you can. I was only on for 8 months when I was 16/17 and my skin is shit now again (I'm 20), honestly considering going on Accutane again because I just don't think my course was long enough.

Hope this helped anyhow :),1,1,0

It all started in the January  of my sophomore year. I had got up from bed to go to the bathroom, and to my surprise, I had an unusual amount of acne on my face. As time went on,  it began to increase in severeness. It had gotten to the point where it began to affect my social life. I was devastated and did not know what to do. I had tried everything from acne.org to proactive, but nothing worked. Feeling helpless, i knew there was only one solution left; a dermatologist. He had prescribed me doxycycline and retin a. 5 months on those had cleared me up pretty good. Now i have been off for about 2 months and still in good shape. Hopefully it will not return. If you guys are feeling helpless or depressed just know that it is not the end of the world and it is just a natural occurrence. Good luck everyone.,9,9,0

Wait! Destiny is that you. Literally this sounds like me. I started spiro last year from Jan for about half the year. I slowly tapered off because I wasn't refilling my prescriptions. I was good for most of the time 2016 but early this year, I began to break out around my period time nothing major to freak but around may this year my gage over my body began to grow crazy and my back acne began to return so I refilled my prescription and I've been on 100mg 50mg in the morning 50 my at night and my skin is smooth and my body is quite hairless. I will never go off of it again, sometimes people can treat their acne with just topicals. ,2,2,0
I had cystic acne since 12 (am 23F now). At 20 I started spiro and was on it for a year. The first few months, I noticed I stopped having daily/weekly breakouts, but a few random ones here and there. It eventually cleared completely and I'd have a minor pimple rarely. 

I quit it for about two years with no major issues, but I may have a cystic pimple during the menstrual cycle. At the start of this year, I moved out of my parents' house and in with my fiance, I started getting frequent cystic/zit breakouts despite a better diet. Since I had a better income, I tried all the OTC treatments, remedies, whatnot. It started to bother me with how frequent and painful it was, so I went to the doc for a prescription for Spiro. I started out on 100mg for the first 2-3 months, and now I'm on 50mg with no issues. 

With both times I started Spiro, I don't think I had any purge. I believe that the acne gradually stopped happening, and the old acne was able to heal. I like... don't do much with my skin anymore regarding cleanliness. I just wash it before bed, moisturize, and wear sunscreen. 

Everyone's body is different, so your experience may be different! I hope my experience provided some insight. Good luck!,1,1,0

- some of the dark hair that appeared on my upper lip (a couple stray hairs, like 5) have gone away
- chest breakouts 100% gone 
- no weight gain but my boobs got a little bigger 
- less hair ‚Äúdown there‚Äù

Spiro cons:
- messed up my periods but it‚Äôs worth it to have clear skin 

TAZORAC (I was on retinol for 3 months and switch to tazorac last month, but it‚Äôs just about the same thing. Retinol hits 1 receptor and tazorac hits 3.)
Tazorac pros:
- no new cysts or breakouts. Maybe a new closed comedone once every 2 weeks but that was normal prior to my sudden onset acne earlier this year 
- smoother skin, helps with scarring 

Tazorac cons:
- still peeling and drying. I had intermittent issues with this and retinol and I think since I‚Äôm starting something that hits more receptors I have to endure it again. Much less than my worst retinol peels though.

I did get an IB/purge when I started retinol in earnest this year. It was horrible for about a month. But I had already quit and restarted once and my derm made me push through. So glad that I did! July was the worst my skin had looked in my entire life (I was 30 and always had had perfect skin... suddenly I had these painful cysts and CC‚Äôs... wtf!) because of the purge but after about 2 months it improved significantly and it‚Äôs only getting better since. My scars are fading and I think being on retinol when the worst part of the breakout was present helped my scars. I have one or two ice pick scars but the majority are red marks that are fading fast. I‚Äôm almost ready to go to work without any foundation on. Maybe another 2 months.

In the interest of full disclosure, I did get diabetic lancets and extract everything I could out of my face during the bad IB. It left red marks that looked terrible for a time but I could hide them under makeup. I couldn‚Äôt hide the bumps that the closed comedones caused. And my skin history has indicated that I can have the same stupid closed comedone for months if I leave it be, so I have zero regrets about extracting them. If you do this, MAKE SURE you know what you‚Äôre doing. If you are at all unsure, you shouldn‚Äôt do it.

I‚Äôm also using Finacea during the day and I love it.

Keep listening to/going to your derm and don‚Äôt give up!!!,1,1,0
Im on both spironolactone and doxycycline and this is my second round of doxy. First round, i cleared up in a month and had clear skin until my prescription ran out. Back on it aswell as spiro since september and my acne is slowly and steadily going away. No purge time either time, just steady improvement!,1,1,0
On 50 mg spironolactone and use a 4% BP face wash. I had no purging with either. Spironolactone has been great for me, it did take close to 7 months to fully kick in for me though. I have forgone all prescription topical treatments because I've usually become resistant to them and haven't found them all that effective to begin with. Tazorac did not make me purge - for me it had no effect whatsoever (but I have pretty tough skin).
Just for reference, I consider true purging an induced effect that causes diffuse blemishes and irritated skin - the classic "gets worse before it gets better" type.
While I have had things that were already in my skin slowly come to the surface, I have not had new blemishes form. So while it could be annoying that these didn't all simply go away, it was such a relief to have much smaller, less painful bumps muuucch less frequently and not anywhere near as dispersed... knowing it was my skin clearing out as opposed to freaking out because of a med. I hope that makes sense and helps.,1,1,0
I have exactly the same thing in exactly the same place . It‚Äôs been there since I can remember. I was told recently they‚Äôre milia (like milk spots babies get) ridiculously stubborn and the best treatment is retinoids. I haven‚Äôt personally tried it as I was breastfeeding my baby when I found out about it and still am (retinoids are a massive no when pregnant or breastfeeding) . I‚Äôm pretty sure I was told glycolic peels as well but i can‚Äôt remember exactly ! Good luck ! ,5,5,0
i have the same shit idk what it is üò©,3,3,0
Have had the same problem for many years. I think they're closed comedones and I heard some people had success with them after using stridex? I only just started trying it though so I'm not sure,4,4,0
Closed comedones. Retinol  or glycolic will help. Caroline gave good advice to get rid of them. ,5,5,0
Milia! Mine went away after about 4-5 weeks using Paula‚Äôs Choice BHA exfoliant. ,4,4,0
I have those too I have a glycolic avid serum that I use that helps they are like blackheads like white hard things under the skin sometimes I wake up in the morning and the glycolic acid has pulled it close to the surface and I pop them out. Or I steam my face poke them with a sterilized needle and squeeze and a skinny white line comes out ,2,2,0
Hmm.. it could be genetic? sometimes the pigmentation of my skin on my face changes in little patches and I've just accepted it at this point. I'd suggest going to a dermatologist though - just to make sure it's nothing to worry about :),1,1,0
It looks like maybe it's milia. Exfoliation, glycolic acid, and retinols help get rid of it. I'm not positive that's what it is though ,1,1,0
Your welcome ,1,1,0
I used Cerave PM and while it did amazing things for plumping my skin and making it feel super soft, it broke me out so badly and I started getting deep under the skin pimples all over my cheeks, which I normally dont get. I'm pretty sure it's because of the Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, derived from coconut oil, which is pretty high on the list of ingredients thats breaking me out. I wish this product didnt break me out because of the rest of the wonderful ingredients. You may or may not be sensitive to the Capric Triglycerides, but it is known for being highly comedogenic and irritating esp. for acne-prone skin. BTW I am also a teenage acne sufferer :),1,1,0
The thing that helped me the most is not eating dairy , not touching my face at all, eating plenty of veggies and fruits, drinkings lots of water and using a mild cleanser w/o alcohol or harsh ingredients (remember to wash hands before you wash your face).  I also try to not drink any sodas, only water and often take a multivitamin.  Another thing that helped me is a sulphate free shampoo, since most shampoos can clog our hair follicles which causes acne.  But I also exercise and meditade to reduce stress.

Good luck! Acne sucks.,2,2,0
Lol thank u I just ordered three bottles. Hoping it works cuz my acne is def hormonal only on my chin and jaw line. Skin is clear all month then erupts for like two weeks before my period which is super irregular ,4,4,0
Thanks! I‚Äôve read stuff about adverse side effects so I‚Äôm a little nervous but we‚Äôll see ,1,1,0
Looks like folliculitis. 

Possible treatments : stop shaving. Trim beard instead. 
Anti-biotics or anti-fungal medication (doctor would need to do a test by taking a swab of the pimples). 
If all else fails - Accutane is the best option.,7,7,0
Have you tried epiduo? It's over the counter now. Try using a towel to brush against your hairs about six to 12 hours after shaving to turn the hairs back up, and try to prevent them from going back into the skin. ,1,1,0

Try hydrocortisone cream on one part. Patch test,1,1,0

It looks like you work out? I would make sure to shower everyday, especially after getting sweaty, and if you wear a lot of under armor or anything, stop. Creatine and protein powder can contribute to acne too, so maybe try cutting down on those if you use them. Change your sheets once a week and invest in a back scrubber. I‚Äôve found making a point to really exfoliate my back helps a lot. You can buy pretty cheap but effective acne solutions from The Ordinary too- retinols and such. 

Some cases really do require the help of a dermatologist though, so if you‚Äôve already taken these steps, I think making an appointment would be worth your while.,3,3,0
Idk my back acne has cleared up sooooooo muchhhhh in the course of 6 months. So what I first did was use the Neutrogena salicylic acid wash (yellow) in the shower. And I would use a black charcoal exfoliator everyday(  i know terrible) . Then I would use coconut oil after I got off and then apply tea tree oil. My chest and back looked so much better the next day!!! So ive did that for a month, I still had a lot of acne but it looked better. Then after that Ive stopped using the coconut oil, and started using Alpha skincare body renewal lotion with glycoloic acid then applied tea tree oil and ive used that for like 2-3 months. After tht most of my acne was gone and I would just wash my body and sometimes apply my clay mask on my chest/back. Right now my acne has cleared up 90% and im left with a huge acne scar (it was there for like 2 years) and just discoloration. I hope this helps. Sometimes I would jist aplly tee tree oil on my body . Tee tree oil doenst hurt/burn on my chest/back because the skin on your body is more thicker and all I feel is a cooling minty sensation. It feels amazing and the only bad thing is that it makes u smell like an old lady lol 
Edit: also, when I wash my hair I try to make sure none of the shampoo touches my face/ body. So I bend over in the shower ahaha 

I hope this helps you.  Change your sleepwear everyday too ,1,1,0
Hi! Medical aesthetician here! Just a warning not to do microdermabrasion on active acne or if you‚Äôre acne prone, it actually spreads the bacteria and can cause more of a problem than fixing it. I recommend a series of salicylic acid peels and glycolic peels! ,2,2,0
Yes I did microdermabrasion and followed it with a chemical peel (I think lactic acid). Cost me $150, and went through a "medical esthetician." She used PCA skincare products and was highly recommended by several friends and worked out of a plastic surgeons office. Before her I had very poor results with estheticians so be careful and do lots of research. A dermatologist is obviously a lot more reputable to go through. Completely changed my pitted cheeks for the better. Good luck!,1,1,0
Perhaps try differin. You can get it at a drug store. Also get some cerave, both the morning and night moisturizers, you have to wear sunscreen if you want to use differin. Also any gentle cleanser like cerave will work too. So in the morning you‚Äôd wash your face then apply the AM cerave. At night, wash your face again. Wait for your face to dry(crucial) then apply a thin layer of the differin wait 15 minutes, then apply the cerave pm moisturizer. When you first start use the differin every few days to avoid hurting your skin. Basically it increases the rate of cell turn over so it may cause some dryness but it should help you. ,2,2,0
Black Soap
Or St ives scrub apricot ,-7,-7,0
Same here. Mine was so bad that I ridges (visibly uneven  and rough skin texture) on my nose. My dermatologist prescribed a tretinoin cream (0.05%) for me and that seems to keep the acne at bay. 

Although, I made no consented effort at observing my skin, a black soap (youtube taught me) called dudu osun seem to have also contributed to my results. I say this because I have used a tretinoin gel alone in the past, but the result was as drastic,1,1,0
never heard of this unless you're allergic to it ,5,5,0
It's usually the opposite - they are high in Zinc which is good for your skin.

If you're eating cheap, low grade quality eggs it could be added hormones and other stuff you don't want affecting your skin. Try get free range, grain fed eggs. ,3,3,0
*sis. Haha, but you're welcome,2,2,0
You might want to try using moisturizer every time you wash your face, before you shower, and after using tea tree oil. I use that same oil, it's great for fast healing of scars but if you don't moisturize with it, it can cause flare ups! ,2,2,0
Vitamin D3 and Zinc supplements helped my oily skin a lot!,1,1,0
My acne came back a couple weeks after quitting doxy. I was on it for 3 months like you. 

Now I‚Äôm back on it and it‚Äôs currently 2.5 months. Face is getting back to normal and it feels great. 

ACNE SUCKS. ,5,5,0
I was on doxy for 2 months and diffrens and 2.5 bp. I had really bad acne mostly hormonal cystics. Ive been off it for 2 months now and while  i havent crazily broken out i still get occasional acne plus ones that havent gone away. Not nearly as bad as i was before. I feel like i will end up getting it all back tho,1,1,0
I used doxy for 4!months. It almost cleared me up and I went off it. My acne came back and is now worse than ever. I'm taking vitamins and I'm hoping I'm having a purge and it's going to clear up but make sure you take probiotics and zinc when you come off it. ,1,1,0
From my experience antibiotics are temporary unfortunately. I hope your outcome was different but for me every time I've come off an antibiotic my acne has returned. On accutane now!,1,1,0
Accutane can help with scarring in that the isotretinoin helps remodel skin and therefore fill in craters.  It works mainly on healing skin so if your scars are older it may not help much.   Obviously consult with your derm but do a thorough risk benefit analysis.  You will experience a purge which will be the absolute worst breakout of your life that can ironically create more scars.  You will also have to deal with 6 months of stupid crazy dry skin, eyes, and lips.  Literally everything will be dry and we‚Äôre talking slather Vaseline all over you dry.  ,2,2,0
No, Accutane will not fix scarring. ,2,2,0
Some scars fade away with time. Accutane may be helpful in a sense that it prevents you from breaking out much more than you usually would which in turn helps the skin heal and fade naturally. If you have serious scarring, you need to go to a dermatologist.,1,1,0
Honestly, if topicals helped clear your acne significantly I would not consider accutane for scarring alone. There are much safer treatments for acne scarring. ,1,1,0
Try taking Vitamin D and Probiotics. They might help, and even if they don't, they're not gonna hurt anything. Probiotics especially might be helpful. ,8,8,0
I am taking Zinc, A and C, and recently started D3 and after a month or so my skin is wayyyyy less oily (and my type is super oily). Pimples heal faster too. And by the way, I think my mental health is better, since I sleep better and don't stress that much.,3,3,0
Try quitting sugar and dairy. I did, and after a few weeks I had undeniable results.  It's not easy, but it's definitely worth it. ,4,4,0
I've heard good things about Dr. Perricone's supplents but never tried them myself. ,2,2,0
Zinc has worked well for me. I would take 50mgs for a few days when my skin flared up and it healed faster. It also makes skin less oily. Some forms are more effective than others, so do your research. 

I currently take Olly‚Äôs Beauty gummy vitamins and drink spearmint tea. This is only likely to work for someone else who has hormonal acne.,2,2,0
I had severe acne for 2 years. Was really bad that I can't even look myself in the mirror. 
I tried taking out dairy and sugar completely for a while and I invested in korean skin care (I do the 8 step routine). You need a lot patience with your skin. Also your emotional and mental health plays a big role in your skin too, so avoid stressing yourself especially over your acne. When it comes to supplements I take Zinc, Fish oil (can be really good for your skin bc of omega3) and Biotin. It took me a long time to completely understand my skin. Hope it helps!  :)

A good diet will help and make sure to drink a it of water, currently you‚Äôve just got spots which disappear eventually. If you‚Äôve got long hair that comes down onto your forehead maybe cut it a bit shorter or try a different style. The products you‚Äôre using seem fine just change a couple things about your lifestyle and you‚Äôll see an improvement 
,4,4,0
You say that the garnier products are good but are they working for you? No. Clinique acne clearing face wash is a good product. Make sure you eat healthy, get rid of sugars and dairy products. Use a simple moisturizer that also includes spf in it for the morning. Then, get a night time moisturizer.  Diet, face wash, and moisturize. You really only need to do those three things and you should see improvement in 2 weeks. ,3,3,0
So ive just hit puberty and doing everything that i can to make my skin clear. My mom keep saying that im ugly because of this and i hate it. Im using Garnier Acne clear right now which i bought since its cheap and good plus i use eskinol for mild teens. I had used Ponds acne clear too. I need something that is cheap but good...

Edit 1: i also forgot that i can't go to a derma since my parents just hate me asf,2,2,0
Have the same thing. My dermatologist took a sample to test it. Can't remember what the results of that were...

We gave up on pills and opted for topical anti biotics, clindagel, a long with using hibiclens as my scalp wash worked great in my chest, and pretty good in my scalp.

But then I started getting the generic clyndomiacine which was a thicker gel and harder to get into my scalp and it's been much less effective.

Talk to a dermatologist.,1,1,0
Most likely folliculitis. 

It may be due to bacteria or fungus. A dermatologist/any doctor can take a sample and test it. 

There often however isn't an exact cause, in which case Accutane is the only reliable option. 

I suffered with this for years. Eventually went on Accutane. ,1,1,0
I get this only when I use too much coconut oil on my hair, too close to my scalp. Same when I use keratin rich conditioners! 

My advice would be, if you are using argan oil, coconut oil, hask products, keratin and biotin hair products- use them on the ends of your hair to the mid length mark. You don't want it getting on your scalp because it clogs pours and can cause acne flair ups. 

I still struggle with these bumps because I'm stubborn and still use coconut oil on my hair a little much, still.,1,1,0
Dr. David Lim does a good video about using fillers for acne scars you might want to watch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IAy1bqTG0k). It also depends of what kind of scar it is. I know you said it's an indent, but is it a rolling indent or ice pick indent. If it's a rolling indent, fillers might work, but for ice pick, they generally don't do so well with filler. You should also realize that fillers are not permanent and you will probably need to get the scar  re-filled every few years (it usually lasts 2-5 years (source: https://www.realself.com/question/sculptra-permanent-option-for-acne-scars)).
Another treatment you also might want to look into if you just have one acne scar is a TCA cross treatment. The dermatologist will use a concentrated acid (TCA) on just the scar (often applied on with a toothpick). 
Another possible option for single scars is a punch graft. This is where they will use a small circular blade about the size of the scar and cut out the scar and replace it with a piece of skin they cut from somewhere else.

It's better to actually properly cleanse after the workout to get rid of the sweat and dirt that accumulated throughout the duration. Sweat is  good for your body, but not good for your skin. ,7,7,0
Definitely wash after a workout. A simple gentle face wash like Vanicream‚Äôs will do. ,3,3,0
I woukd also recommend washing the face at night and as needed, but washing with just water is ok in the morning. ,1,1,0
I asked my dermatologist this exact question and he said to wash within 30 minutes of a work out. The sweat, oil, and dirt is a breeding ground for acne causing bacteria. If you skin dries out from the extra washing, try using a either using a non-comedogenic moisturizer afterwords or using a hydrating cleanser.,1,1,0
What is your current routine? I would suggest seeking a good derm. ,3,3,0


Since I went off the pill in march last year my skin is has been riddled with acne. Only mild and medium at sometimes. I've spent probably about a couple of grand trying to fix it with antibiotics (doxy), microdermabrasion, acupuncture too much natural skin care to even write down. 

I eat a balanced vegan diet (healthy) and drink lots of fluids. I take b12, magnesium, probiotics and b5 acne vitamins. I use the neutrogena light boosting mask (has not helped at all) and use an oil based cleanser to wash my face once every morning and night. And I use alo Vera to moisturise. 

I have normal-dry skin 

Can someone please help me!??My skin is so fucked yo at the moment. The worst I have ever seen it. I'm about to turn 24 and I don't want this plaguing my life anymore. 

Give me advice.

Looks a lot like my acne, mine is mainly hormonal. - I had to go to a dermatologist and was suggested to get Differin. You can Get it at the store now. It‚Äôs been great! Use it every two days along with lavender mixed with aloe gel every night and absolutely NO touching.

You're gonna love it! I was on accutane and after many years of being so ashamed of my skin, it helped sooo much and brought back my confidence.

I don‚Äôt have the most perfect skin but I have been noticing that if I keep with my current routine, I am able to have an acne-free skin. 
1. Wash your face with cleanser then use exfoliate cleanser 
2. Apply alcohol-free toner 
3. Moisturize moisturize moisturize!
4. Sunblock 
I do this every day and night. (For nighttime, please apply night cream. Oh and don‚Äôt forget to drink lots and lots of water !!!!,3,3,0
I'm a "picker".  
I get hydrocolloid bandages and cut them into tiny circles-- I place them on the worst pimples I have overnight. They seem to "soak up" the gunk inside. If a pimple is really stubborn, I'll poke it with a very fine needle and then put the hydrocolloid bandage on top of it.  
Seems to *really curb* my picking at night. The texture of the bandages are very "skin-like" so they don't catch on pillowcases, etc. The deep zits that used to take weeks to heal can sometimes disappear in less than a week if I use these. 
Other than that, schedule an appointment with a dermatologist if you can, or ask your primary care doctor if he or she can prescribe something for you in the meantime. ,3,3,0
I used to have really bad acne. Had to go on accutane twice for atleast a combined total of a year and a half. That solved the cystic acne but I was still getting smaller pimples with a few deeper ones like you described. Just recently my sister started eating gluten free and I thought I would try it. It seems to have mostly worked, im down to one or two small pimples at any one time. I believe the antibiotics I was on while on accutane destroyed my gut health so iv been drinking kombutcha (a fermented tea) and yogurt to try and promote good gut bacteria too. I do miss normal bread but it might be worth trying.,1,1,0
Stop picking!,1,1,0
I think you should try to avoid picking and popping pimples, as a start! I also pop and pick, but I've learned that leaving the pimple alone allows it to heal better, if that makes sense. The PIH from a pimple that is unpicked/popped usually clears up faster than one that is, at least for me. 
As for the acne on your cheekbones, do you wear blush or highlighter? Some of my friends get pimples from blush. 
In terms of getting rid of scars, they may just be PIH (unless you are sure they are scars). In either case, sunblock is very important to make sure they don't get darker in color. Also, if you can, visiting a derm may help you find a face wash/help with scars. ,1,1,0
Looks like clogged pores/blackheads. Have you tried changing your detergent? Body soap? You could also try a medicated acne wash that could be found at the drugstore. 


,3,3,0
Hi medical aesthetician here! It looks more like hyperpigmentation from past breakouts, I say use a salicylic acid based body cleanser which should help prevent the breakouts then after that has cleared up go hard on some peels at a spa to shed those darkness 
Maybe even layering salicylic acid cleanser with a mndelic acid or lactic acid cleanser 

Side note
Causes could be from sweat, improper washing and scrubbing of back and not changing your bed sheets frequently if you sleep a la nude ,3,3,0

I found that changing diet helped. Avoiding dairy is a big one, dairy can make hormonal acne worse and cause more acne. Grains (wheat, corn, etc) and sugar can cause inflammation to be worse, avoid them when you have a breakout. And processed food in general is really bad. Focus on a balanced diet, pay attention to what you eat and the effect it has on your skin, start making food and avoid junk food. I tried everything and diet change had a huge impact,7,7,0
Looks hormonal. Meaning putting external products on your face isn't really going to work. Zinc supplements/tablets are cheap and very effective in balancing hormones and boosting your body's ability to fight off the infections under your skin. Stopped my cystic bumps!

Also cut out sugar and dairy because those cause inflammation.,5,5,0
Try a gentler routine. wash your face 2x a day with cetaphil. i like the body shop's tea tree oil line for toner and spot treatment. ,2,2,0
Make sure you take your time and test how each product affects your face! When I switch up my routine and use a lot of new products at once, I break out, and then I don't know what caused it. 
Definitely, stop with the alcohol cleanser, it may be too drying, and aggravate your acne and your face! Also, is the scar cream design for your face? I know I used Mederma on my face for a time and it definitely did not agree with my skin. 
I know that my derm gave me retinol which helped with my PIH and also makes my skin soft and helps my scabs fall off faster.
Also don't try to pick cystic acne! Or any acne! I'm always self-conscious of my scabs and red spots, but I hold this mantra to myself that it's better to have acne/pimple than a scab. Sometimes we do pop/pick and thats human! 
Also, I can only see a part of your face, but you look lovely! Don't be hard on yourself, your acne isn't your doing and it doesn't define you! ,2,2,0
Your routine seems harsh! I don't know where you're based but the Cetaphil and Cerave cleansers and moisturisers are gentle and effective for problem skin, and available in many countries. Ditch the alcohol cleanser and coconut oil! 

Maybe use a leave on treatment with salicylic acid (bha) rather than a wash. People love the Stridex red box, Paula's choice 2% bha is a good one I have used, if a bit pricey. Use at night after cleansing, slowly work up to using every night. For spot treatment, get some benzoyl peroxide (cheap!) and apply after BHA at night, or in the morning after cleansing. Moisturise every day and use a sunscreen where possible, it will help reduce additional scarring. Hydrocolloid plasters can be used overnight on active acne too,2,2,0
Try going dairy free. ,1,1,0
Seems like your acne looks really painful and deep, although the rest of your skin looks nice... I'm not sure if simple skin washes will curb the cysts. It might cost you less in the long run to seek professional medical help. I had some acne like that in my teens particularly, and the only thing that helped initially were antibiotics. I subsequently went on accutane 2x.    
Some non-profit hospitals have discount plans for indigent/low income people. I work for one, and even I qualify for their discount program. They use programs like these to justify their nonprofit status. In the hospital I work at, you could possibly see an outpatient primary care physician and pay practically nothing. At the very least, they could prescribe antibiotics or birth control pills. Some dermatology medication manufacturers have discount plans as well.   
Don't know if this would help-- if you're not on birth control, some people swear by it. If you live near a Planned Parenthood or have a GYN.... Personally, I had no luck with any BCPs. Some people swear by spearmint tea-- I think it might have helped with my monthly outbreaks these past two months.  
Aside from that, I really love to use hydrocolloid bandages for zits at night-- they keep me from popping and seem to suck a lot of the pus out. You can cut them into tiny circles. They're often sold as "blister bandages". Can be pricy if you buy a lot of them, but they're great for the really deep pimples. You could buy one pack and see, maybe test a pimple that won't be too obvious if the bandage doesn't agree with your skin. Doesn't seem as if your face is covered with them all over, so you might not need a whole lot of them.    
For me, the hydrocolloid bandages are the best for preventing me from turning a small breakout into a big widespread, "picked skin" breakout.   
Personally, benzoyl peroxide irritates my face, as does salicylic acid and stridex type pads. I had better luck with glycolic, AHA, and mandelic acid based products. At drugstores they sell differin gel now, which used to be a prescription. I disliked differin (retinol), but it might work for you. Most drug stores accept refunds if you return your purchases quickly. If you tried products at Sephora or Ulta, they'll accept returns as well. Sephora also sells sample sizes. The high end beauty stores have some great products. Whenever I've had to return something due to an adverse reaction, they never gave me problems, although I don't do that often.   
I would also second Cetaphil non-foaming cleanser... drying skin washes were always discouraged by any dermatologists I've seen. I suppose they make inflammation flair up. Right now I use Aquation, which is similar to Cetaphil.  ,1,1,0

I had been on antibiotics (Doxy,Bactrim) for three years and about a month ago I stopped because I didn't want to take antibiotics anymore. I experienced no terrible breakout after I stopped taking them, however, my skin is much more sensitive. I have found that food is my main issue as anything with refined sugars or a lot of oils will absolutely wreak havoc on my skin. If you do stop just continue washing your face with your normal face wash and see where you end up in a couple weeks. If your face goes to shit then start to change your routine and experiement with other products and lifestyle changes. Acne works differently for everyone obviously so try not to shy away from different products. From my experience antibiotics aren't really a solution, but more of a shitty pill you take that just reduces the effects. For you it may be different and your skin may not notice any change. Best of luck!,2,2,0
Electric shaver is totally worth the cost. I got a nice Braun one and it completely helped with my acne. Try Aveeno Natural shaving cream too, doesn‚Äôt clog pores and helps with little to no irritation ,1,1,0
I personally like using a double-edged safety razor. Cheaper in the long run, and can be sanitized easily with scrubbing bubbles.  
I don't use it on my face, but some guys swear they work better if you're acne prone. The ingrown hair problem and infected follicles I used to have are gone. If you get one, watch some tutorials online so you don't cut yourself.  
My one brother had acne and always used electric razors, however. You might be able to get some good discounts on decent electric razors right now since it's close to Xmas. If you're willing to wait, try to get one on black Friday. (Might not apply if you're not living in the US.)
Either option is probably better than those multi blade razors with the multiple strips-- they probably harbor all sorts of bacteria and fungi after several uses. ,1,1,0

Oh yikes witch hazel and St ives scrub are very drying (st ives is pretty rough on your face too). Depending on where you live Sukin do a great cream cleanser thats very minimally drying. Their moisturiser is great too and they're both around $10. ,1,1,0

I would just switch to a gentle cleanser like Vanicream‚Äôs. ,2,2,0
Definitely moisturize no matter your skin type. I use Vanicream‚Äôs lite lotion and really like it. ,1,1,0
I agree with castle. Moisturizing will help heal your skin. If it's irritated redness, moisturizing will for sure help. if it's scarring like you say, moisturizing is definitely better than doing nothing and just cleansing. Also, if it's PIH scarring, using an AHA or BHA will help with that. In your case, it's probably PIE since you describe it as red. I would try using AHA or BHA to help aid the fading of it, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PIE WILL ONLY FADE WITH TIME (OR LASER TREATMENT). 

If you go with the laser treatment route, definitely do your research and see if you are comfortable with the process and cost. 

If you introduce AHAs or BHAs, don't overapply them because it will simply do more harm than good. Start off 2 times a week with AHAs and BHAs and build up to a point your skin is comfortable with.,1,1,0
Accutane makes your skin VERY sensitive. When I was on it, I couldn't use any harsh type of face wash or topicals. You'll see the drastic change it has on your skin so you shouldn't need topicals. I highly recommend using sunscreen every day! It's weird, you'll honestly feel your body being sensitive to the harsh sunlight. And drink plenty of water. And first and foremost, invest in a very hydrating lip balm!! Those were the 3 things I made sure to do on accutane and it helped me a lot. It's a strong drug so just be kind to your body! But i hope you're happy with the results!! It's gonna be an amazing transformation! ,1,1,0
Keep your body clean, use body scrub 2 times a week, cut out dairy,... Try products containing benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acids like body wash by Neutrogena or Murad.,1,1,0
Try expanding your skincare regime.

Have you ever considered an AHA? It increases cell turnover and definitely unclogs my pores.,2,2,0
Ever since my teens ive always felt like my skin was bloated/puffy. I have tried every single product out there and i dont know what else to do. I dont break out as often now but my pores are clogged 24/7. I wash my face 2-3 times a day with a salicylic acid cleanser but i feel like it just cleans the upper portion of my skin. I also produce a ton of sebum. When i say a ton, i mean i clean my nose and the next day it will produce the same if not more sebum as the day before. Mostly comes from my nose, cheeks and the sides of my chin. 
I have done my research and the apparent problem is DHT. This past year ive started to notice hair thinning and loss as well. This leads me to believe it could be DHT. If so, what the hell can i do about it? Any and all advice is very much appreciated.

Some info about me: 22 y/o, 5.10 ft, 165 lbs
Im pretty fit, exercise, and follow a relatively healthy diet. ,1,1,0
It‚Äôs because your facial pores are still clogged with oil even after using cleanser. Try to use cleansing water before that like Bioderma, Garnier and balance your skin‚Äôs pH with toner (Lush, Neutrogena, La roche posay,...). You‚Äôll see the difference after a week :),2,2,0
Since you DO have pcos, it might be hormonal.  Lower cheeks chin an jawline point to hormonal :( it sucks i know cuz i suffer from a similar problem. If you want and if you think you‚Äôre face can handle it. To mix a bit of diffren(adapalene) with 2.5% benzoly peroxide. Its hard to find a 2.5 one but id start low and work you‚Äôre way up to higher bps if you think youll need to. Also a sensitive moisture in the daytime like cerave. Im bad at remembering to moisturize lol. Also obviously like everyone says. Water and less sugar. Its hard cuz im addictive to pop and juice :( good luck !!!,1,1,0
Thanks! I use bp 10% but I'll try what u said. It's cleared up now since I've started washing with a facial brush! ,1,1,0
I also did not change my diet. I had dairy, candy and my other food triggers and I still cleared up. ,2,2,0
You can really get all this online???? That‚Äôs interesting. I hear all about how accutane is the worst thing to do but also helps. Id be worried about the bad breakout youll get ior the problems that can happen with accutane,1,1,0
No. I use Differin, which is half the ingredients in Epiduo, and it says right in the instructions that using it more often than once a day WILL NOT improve effectiveness. It will only cause (more) irritation. 

Since Epiduo is basically Differin + Benzoyl Peroxide, I‚Äôm assuming the same time period applies (although Epiduo is usually more effective), which is 3 months. That‚Äôs how long you have to use it to get results, according to the studies they‚Äôve done (although some see results after only 2 weeks). What I mean to say here is consistent use is more important than how often it is applied. ,3,3,0
You just have to weigh the pros and cons honestly. Is your acne life changing enough that it‚Äôs worth the risk to you or not? It‚Äôs such a hard decision. I decided it was worth any risk. It‚Äôs been very hard but I believe it will be worth it. Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll make the right decision! Good luck,4,4,0
I did Accutane was the best decision I ever made, be careful and watch for side effects. I went from pizza face to now several years later mild acne. It left permanent results, I'm considering going on one more cycle since I had no side effects while I was on it.,3,3,0
I spoke to my derm about the extreme side effects (depression etc) and he said if you watch fox and friends all day you would think you would die on the drug, so make an educated decision about it instead of reading articles online.

Also, read the clinical trials Roche did for this years ago. No clear link to depression/ED. I used to have exzema years ago which has come back, that is currently my worst side effects (apart from the dry lips haha)

I hope you go for the drug, I'm only 1.5 months in and  yet to have a cyst!!,1,1,0
What have you tried? Have you tried the acne.org regimen and STUCK to it consistently? That's what worked for me, from extremely bad cystic acne to clear skin in about 1 month. 

I started it in 2004 and still do my own modified version of it to this day. I've just added some anti-ageing products to the mix. ,1,1,0
It is ultimately a decision you will have to make and weigh the risks of possible ED with the risks of having acne (ex. possible lowered self esteem and scaring). I think the best thing to do is to have a frank conversation with your dermatologist about it. 

I did some searching on realself.com, a website where people post questions and they are answered by physicians (not some random person on the internet). The dermatologists on there answered questions about ED and didn't seem very concerned about it. Here are a links of some of those questions:

Im a 21 year old male. Acne ruined my life back in high school. Overtime during college, my acne went away. This semester starting from August to present, I've been struggling with acne. I don't know why. I used to have really clear skin over this summer. People would compare my skin to those Korean K-pop dudes lol Now I look horrible with breakouts on my chest, back, jawline, neck, and my face. For treatments, I am avoiding dairy, eat clean, I applying benzyl peroxide, moisturizer, drinking and applying apple cider vinegar to my face, applying turmeric mixed with honey and lime twice a week, and very little results after three months. My pimples would go away for a few days leaving horrible dark spots, then I would break out again. I should note that I don't pick, touch, or pop my pimples. My face is not dry or flaky. I change my pillow sheets every day, and my bed sheet once a week. I shower before going to bed. 

I've been working out (bulking) over the summer. Eating 5,000 calories every day, 300g protein, 300g carbs. Eating chicken, beef, spaghetti, whey protein, eggs, peanut butter, and many more. I did not break out from bulking, but for some reason, my acne started to appear two weeks after my bulk. I stopped bulking in the beginning of August. Its been about 3 months and I still continue to develop acne. Within the past week, I'm starting to have cyst too. I've never developed cyst until this past week. 

I am stressed because I work and go to school full time, but I know this is not the issue. During the spring of 2017, my face was clear. I worked and go to school full time, only getting 4 hours of sleep every night, and I had no acne. But for some reason, I am breaking out now...

I don't know what's wrong. Are my hormones off for some odd reason? Are my estrogens too high from all the protein, calorie intake? But I stopped all that bulking 3 months ago... Please give me feedback

Also, I have an appointment to see a dermatologist this coming Wednesday. I've done many research on Accutane, the benefits, side effects, etc. How would I go along with asking my doctor for a prescription of Accutane? I'm more worried that my doctor would prescribe me a different medication. ,1,1,0
https://imgur.com/a/iXYRc ,1,1,0
Honestly I never got cystic acne until I tried fighting it with benzoyl peroxide. That shit ruined my skin. How oily is your skin? How often do you cleanse?

I wouldn't jump straight to accutane unless you're seriously desperate. It's a last resort, and isn't always a permanent fix. If you've tried everything else then it's worth a shot. 

Have you been on any medications, antibiotics, drinking much, excess fatty foods? That might mess with your gut health. Google Candida overgrowth and acne. Probiotics might be a really good thing to include in your daily routine regardless. ,1,1,0
My skin is naturally oily. It's been oily since 8th grade or so. I cleanse every morning and night with cold water. I then apply benzoyl along with moisturizer. My face is not dry at all. As for food, I've been avoiding greasy food, whey protein, dairy, etc for the past 3 months. Yet, no results. And yeah, I'm just really desperate to get rid of this acne because I'm in the field of Public Safety. People don't take an officer seriously who has acne, seriously. I just want my face cleared up so I can be confident instead of faking it,1,1,0
Stop eating whey. Whey is the cause of acne for many people, especially those who frequently workout. Whey and dairy are awful for acne. 

Try cutting those out and seeing if it helps. ,1,1,0
Jawline acne with a good diet is 90% of the time hormonal acne. You probably don't actually have to go all the way to accutane. Ask your derm for this https://www.fabior.com/patient/why-fabior/. 

As far as the body acne goes if your doctor ends up giving you an antibiotic, be sure to use a probiotic as well. Optimally you should want both the foam and the antibiotic. This probably happened initially because of the whey causing a hormone spike at some point which caused you to get hormonal acne. The acne then spread after the bacteria colonized under your skin to other areas. At this point cutting out dairy isn't going to do much until you get actual treatment.

I had a similar problem like yours when I was taking two scoops of whey with 2 glasses of milk every day due to time constraints on my diet. I broke out heavily, and attempted to quell it by eliminating dairy but it didn't work. I learned that cutting off dairy does very little if the bacteria has already colonized. At a certain point the only way to get rid of it is to get a strong antibiotic or some other strong treatment like accutane/the foam. Considering that the acne has become severe enough to hit your chest I think you are at that point. 

I did not think I had a bad relationship with dairy until after my skin cleared and I would notice immediately the day after having any dairy that I would get slight amounts of acne. I'm 20 right now, and less than a year ago I was downing like 4 cups of whole milk, and cheese pretty much everyday and remained clear. My breakout seemed to be the breaking point for me and dairy it seems. 

I'm half asian and my body can process milk without shitting itself, but my skin is now intolerant to dairy. Considering you're asian theres a strong chance that happened as well. The whey protein is a strong case for your acne getting continually worse. Whey contains IGF-1 which is a hormone, that can fuck up your own hormones and give you hormonal acne. I switched off whey to a protein called veggie elite, which is not nearly as grainy as the other plant based proteins. I would recommend it. 

For reference this is me about 4 months ago, and me now.

If it's primarily around your beard and neck area-- could it possibly be a fungal issue? Tinea barbae? Seborrheic dermatitis? Seborrheic dermatitis likes to show up on people's chests and necks as well as scalp/face.  
Maybe try Nizoral on your skin and see if it helps...

Its probably cystic acne. Red bumps under the skin with no white heads. Cystics hard to treat. They last a while.  Do your best not to pick or try to pop them or youll scar.

Doxy takes time to work. Doxy is also usually paired with benzol peroxide. antibiotic combined with benzol peroxide is one o fthe most effective way to kill acne.

That area is typically linked to hormone imbalances. If you're out of your teen years, I would recommend getting your hormones tested.

It happens for absolutely no rhyme or reason, and I personally found that just giving up looking for some obscure dietary answer and accepting it was the best route.

Here are my before and after pictures from the spring of 2017, to present

https://imgur.com/gallery/RHXyh ,1,1,0
The fact that your acne is concentrated around your hairline and facial hair area leads me to thinks it's a type of folliculitis (bacteria that gets into damaged hair follicles and can create havoc for your skin)

See a doctor regardless, but it can be treated with an OTC anti-fungal and incorporating a high quality probiotic into your diet. Incorporating healthy oils can help people manage their skin oil production as well (I make a smoothie in the morning with flax and castor oil in it).

I'm guessing that you are working out more, which means you are showering more frequently and this can disrupt the natural bacteria on your skin, in addition, folliculitis that is fungal/yeast in nature won't respond to acne medication as it's not actual "acne" but a non-acne type of bacteria inhabiting the pore, so upping your BP or salicylic acid use can just irritate the skin, leading to more oil production and more "traditional" bacteria acne.

Moisturize with a gel moisturizer every time you wash your face, use BP as spot treatment only, and buy an anti-fungal/ probiotic rich cream. 

Good luck :) provide updates if you skin changes whether it's for the better or worse!,1,1,0

I'm not an expert by any means, but I have a few medical conditions and have spent a while trying to solve my acne as well. One of my med issues is IBS, and I've been prone to constipation if anything. One thing I've worked hard to solve is my gut health. My gut bacteria got pretty messed up from years of antibiotics, some of which were pretty intense. My acne seemed to resemble that of what occurs from Candida overgrowth (candida is one of the bad bacteria in our gut that needs to be controlled by good bacteria). Good diet, good digestion both impact our gut health. Avoiding too much alcohol, sugar, fatty foods helps your gut bacteria a lot and would also help general digestion.

Something else that would coincide with poor skin and poor digestion/irregular bowels is dehydration. ,1,1,0

I've noticed a massive difference. I wouldn't recommend using these gels or using the three step system with your topical medication though. Have you tried oral medication prescribed by your derm?
,2,2,0
Stick with the epiduo. It‚Äôs so painful at first, I remember my face felt like it was on fire but it cured my acne for about over a year and really minimized my breakouts. It‚Äôs a retinol so it works by increasing cell turnover. The clindamycin is good for Whitehead‚Äôs and active acne. Try slowly encorporating the epiduo, every other day then build up. ,1,1,0
I have PCOS, so I'm kinda a pro at hormonal imbalance and the acne that comes with it. Honestly, I'm not sure if what you're describing is truly hormonal acne as this usually just along the jawline, chin, and mouth area. Also, the bumps are deep under the skin and cystic. 

I've found that diet and supplements are the best way to tackle hormonal acne. Do you have a lot of sugar because that can also be a huge trigger (it is for me). What vitamins do you take? Maybe you need to add extras in to balance out your hormones. I use a simple face wash and no moisturizer. Instead, I use a face serum in the mornings and aloe vera gel at night. I spot treat with BP cream as needed.,1,1,0
>I did this for about 2 months straight, however, I found that my face would burn incredibly and be super tender to the touch, almost like it was burnt, so I stopped

I would say it took 3 weeks of everyday use untill the burning subsides ,1,1,0
If epiduo burns/drys your skin out you should probably cut back to using it 2-3 times a week and moisturize a lot during the day. Then you can slowly start to use it more.,1,1,0
Put the N+Z serum in at night, after your toner. 
Vitamin C helps with brightening and also boosts effectiveness of sunscreen. Use it in the morning, after toning or mixed with sunscreen. ,1,1,0
Sometimes Accutane doesn't completely rid your skin of acne. You're still 20 years old and have hormone fluctuations. Is your acne better than before you started Accutane? If so, then it worked to some degree. I would talk to your prescribing doctor about this if you have further questions. ,2,2,0
Hi, I am on accutane myself and r/accutane is the best sub for this question. I read all of the posts there and from what I've read accutane will continue to improve your skin for up to two months after your course, after which your skin should settle down :),1,1,0
I haven't tried accutane but all i have heard is that it takes time even after dosage completion.,0,0,0
I'd say 'mild'. I'd swap you! ;),2,2,0
I would agree with the previous comment, I think that would be considered mild. I have much of a similar situation, and while I still have some body acne, there are a couple simple things I've done that REALLY helped me. The first thing was I constantly change my shirt. Prior, I would sleep in the same shirt or something but now I change before going to bed and especially after taking a shower/working out (which I've always done but still). Some of the other tips I used from this really helpful video:  https://youtu.be/G1G-zaqwXC8    some of the tips apply more to girls, but it may help you too. I have yet to try the products she mentions in the video, but it may be worth a shot. ,2,2,0

I do ! usually two pimples inevitably form a line but when i go get 3 collinear pimples it's usually because i scratched that area with my bare fingernails in the same "shape" lol,7,7,0

I'm currently using duac acne gel which contains 5% Benzoyl Peroxide together with a non-comedogenic moisturiser and have been seeing some great results so far (I have moderate acne on cheeks) without the moisturiser it would simply be too drying and irritating and it even suggests to use one in the directions of the gel. I'm not sure if it changes the effectiveness but having dry irritated skin is not gonna do you any good either so I'd say go for it.,1,1,0
[removed],1,1,0
Your suppose to moisturize after benzol peroxide.

Apply the BP. Wait til it dry and then moisturizer 

also, only use 2.5% benzol peroxide.   
10% BP will wreck your skin,1,1,0
I use acne patches, it allows me to press lightly on the pimple without introducing bacteria to it while it does it's thing, best thing that I ever found.,2,2,0
Could it be from shaving or irritation?,1,1,0
Do you touch there a lot or maybe its from past irritation and you just need to leave it alone to heal on its own i had to do that. But also whenever i got zits there it was because of high sugar diet ,1,1,0
do you ever eat any oily/greasy foods? cause i notice when i eat greasy and the grease gets around my mouth it kind of makes me break out around there,1,1,0
The only thing I can think of is that your skin might be irritated if you‚Äôre often sticking on and peeling off the bandages. Other than that it should be fine. Might get expensive though, I get them for 75¬¢ a bandage and for me, and the amount of acne I have, that‚Äôs just not sustainable. ,3,3,0
A hydrocolloid bandage will only work if there is an opening for the puss to leak out and that's typically only when the white head has completely come out. So when you see a pimple wait until it comes to a full head and then use the bandage. If you want to get the gunk out right away i guess you could speed up the process with a bunch of methods. Clay masks work the best in my opinion.,1,1,0
Dont worry about it you look beautiful sometimes we are to selfcritical with ourselfes.,8,8,0
Look up TCA CROSS.  It is the absolute best solution for your situation.  You have icepick scars/possibly enlarged pores.  You can do TCA Cross at home and see substantial results.

Get off of reddit and go to acne.org.  Realself is also good but it's tough to navigate the website sometimes.  Acne.org will give you EVERYTHING you need.  Post these pictures and you will get replies from people who have had acne scars for years, tried numerous treatment, etc.  You have to go to the scar treatment section on the website.

Feel free to message me if you need any advice.    ,3,3,0
I don‚Äôt know if they sell it where you live but in Australia we have bio oil which I use on my acne scars and it‚Äôs no magic overnight treatment but I definitely see an improvement. It‚Äôs only about $15 AUD for a little bottle which can last around 6 months so I highly suggest looking into that ,2,2,0
benzol peroxide wash on the back is worth a shot. ,2,2,0
I would try another strain of antibiotic before then looking at accutane. Topicals are very hard to use on the back because of how easy it is to miss places and the acne you get on your back can be very stubborn.

If someone really loves you, it doesn't matter what you look like. If she can't see pass something you consider a physical imperfection then you don't want her anyway! Looks fade and we all end up wrinkly and saggy, so when you find real love it should be for what's inside! ,20,20,0
Don't use any harsh scrubs especially while your still dealing with spots and redness. If you want to look good, the best thing you can do is prevent it from getting worse. So instead of worrying to much about the current acne, (which obviously will go away eventually), focus on the possible acne that can come again maybe tomorrow or in a week, or in a month. 
Best prevention = sunscreen + non comedogenic cleanser + non comedogenic moisturizer (or even rosehip/jojoba oil!),6,6,0

Tazorotene and tretinoin are both pretty drying and irritating, so a gentle non-medicated cleanser would be recommended, at least until your skin has adjusted to the strength. I like the non-foaming cleansers that Neutrogena, Cetaphil, and Cerave make. ,1,1,0

As a nurse I get so much shit from patients.

Straight up "what on earth is wrong with your face?" usually followed by "is it contagious?" 

"How can I trust you've washed your hands when you can't even wash your face?" sometimes with a "don't touch me" thrown in for good luck

I had one confused patient (who was being a very disruptive influence in a male bay because she was convinced that they were all her husband) get very annoyed at me trying to contain her behaviour and get her back to here own bed tell me that the reason that she was being so difficult was because she was allowed to be nasty to somebody with "skin like a pig" and then picked at one of my nodules üëç
She was well past it though so I can't really hold her to too much...


Throughout my training I was often brought up about the state of my skin by ward managers. Sometimes indirectly, a comment about smartening up before the shift started, sometimes a more serious thinly veiled criticism. I knew exactly what they were getting at but played dumb.. One woman in particular sat me down at one point and told that I didn't present myself particularly professionally all the time. 

'Oh. I'm surprised to hear that you believe that I behave unprofessionally, Martha? I have not received this feedback from anybody else so far' 

'No your behaviour is fine I literally just mean presentation. Patients want a clean and tidy well put together nurse.'

'Well... If my hair is tied up as the dress code states, and I'm wearing my uniform as the dress code states, and I'm wearing smart black closed toe shoes as the dress code states and I do not have nail polish on as the dress code states and I am not wearing any jewellery as the dress code states then I'm not quite enough sure what you're talking about Martha..??'


It was fucking ridiculous. I was instantly reminded of the articles that I had read regarding black women being told that their natural hair was unprofessional. Of course I know that given that this interaction wasn't routed in systematic racism it is in no way equivalent but as a white woman it was probably the closest experience I will ever have to that kind of interaction with a superior. Does she think I WANT to have skin like this?? My face hasn't belonged to me for 10 fucking years. I have serious self esteem issues that have caused me spending more than I can afford on attempting to rod myself of it and to cover it up with expensive make up and now you're telling me that I'm perceived to be less competent to care for other people because of this? Fuck that noise. ,39,39,0
When I was in junior high the nurse called me to her office.

"Well we've gotten some complaints about what's growing on your chin so I need to have a look "

I was so hurt. Like the acne was rough but I've had ocd that leads to intense picking for a long time. The acne on my chin was picked so much it was basically just a big scab the size of a quarter. It stayed for nearly 2 years. But I'll never forget that nurse and how low and disgusting I felt.,21,21,0
I‚Äôve had a grown man walk by me in public and make a ‚Äúholy shi-‚Äú type of remark.

It‚Äôs endless because I‚Äôve had bad acne since I was a preteen. ,12,12,0
I have been called "cold-sore-city" by a guy literally just walking by.

I've had a guy tell me, "I think you're awesome but I could never date a woman who is lower maintenance than me. Like... If I wash every day, my girl should too." (No, I wasn't interested in him, and no, I don't smell.),11,11,0

I was a counselor in training at a horse riding camp this summer. In between riding sessions, we were having the kids chill in the shade, do some crafts, whatever. One boy (11 years old) decides to go over to a muddy area and start putting mud on people‚Äôs faces as a ‚Äúspa treatment‚Äù just for shits and giggles. I go over there to watch over him and a few others to make sure he doesn‚Äôt do anything stupid, when he asks me if I want the ‚Äúfacial‚Äù too. I politely decline, because I 100% know it would break me out and I was also wearing makeup. He then has the audacity to say ‚Äúyou sure? It would help all those nasty pimples on your face‚Äù Like fucking really kid??? Really?? Since I‚Äôm not allowed to slap his ass to the goddamn moon, I just chuckle and walk away, but it really really hurt. He was old enough to know that was not an acceptable thing to say. 

I was talking with one of my new friends and somehow skincare comes up. I say something along the lines of ‚Äúwell, I just started a new skincare routine and‚Äù but before I could finish, she cuts me off and says ‚Äúreally? Well what are you doing wrong? I wanna know so I don‚Äôt do that‚Äù Damn that one stung. I was wearing makeup too. I could only imagine what people would say if I brought myself to show my real face to those around me. I‚Äôm so jealous of everyone around me. It seems that no one has acne or scarring this bad. I know it could totally be worse, but it still sucks. ,6,6,0

Lets see,

Oh I‚Äôve got a good one. 

This happened a few months back. I play a game called Overwatch and there was a little tournament held here in Santa Monica. Well being from around LA, I was down to go and my friend asked if I could bring them. I said of course, and we headed to Santa Monica the following weekend. Well fast-forward past the mediocre event to the long journey we embarked on afterwards. We thought it would be cool to walk from the building that the tournament was held, to muscle beach next to the pier. I stayed up all night prior to this event because I was a little excited, turns out it was all for nothing because we left the event super early due to my boredom mainly.

  We reach the beach finally after waiting for my friend to get enough energy to keep walking forward (which was a little bit annoying) and wrap up a quick workout on the beach. I‚Äôm a little self-conscious about my acne, it really destroys me inside, but I am a narcissist about my body, because it helps me take the focus off of my skin.

So we‚Äôre walking back to the venue, and around 10 blocks in, this middle-aged African American woman walks around the corner. Obviously my skin looks atrocious at this point, a long workout and no sleep will do this to you.. I‚Äôm all sweaty, look like hell, and am totally unmotivated to keep walking back to this damn venue to just go home and call it a day when suddenly she raised her voice at me and confronted me about my terrible skin situation. ‚ÄúBoy, what the hell is going on?‚Äù She asked. Proceeding to tell me that I need proactive, I felt so defeated that I couldn‚Äôt even muster up a response. Usually I‚Äôm pretty defensive and as much as I can bring somebody up and make them feel good about themselves, I can be a real fucking asshole. Well, this was different, it totally shook me up... and my friend proceeded to laugh at the woman‚Äôs comment (which I thought was pretty insensitive) and I said, ‚ÄúWhatever dude, let‚Äôs keep fucking walking.‚Äù 

Eventually, we made it back in town hours later and I dropped them off. After such a long day, I was so relieved when a questionable SO??? was there for me talk to awaiting my arrival. This made me felt 200x better and I even stayed up late just to talk to them because of how they make... or in this case, made me feel at the time.. :/

So that‚Äôs my worst experience I guess, I really don‚Äôt show myself very often, I‚Äôm so disgusted by it myself that I don‚Äôt give others the chance to degrade me, other than online. Come to think of it, I‚Äôm sure I stayed up for like 36 hours on that particular day. Man, the things you do for the people that make you feel good.. it‚Äôs crazy.,5,5,0

1. You could go for a laser treatment (Usually Expensive) 
2. Continue taking good care of your skin. Buy a toner, moisturizer and a pimple medication cream that is suitable for your skin.During the morning,wash your face with an acne face wash, then tone your face using a cotton sheet. After your face dries up, apply moisturizer evenly to your face. Before bedtime, repeat the process and apply Your acne medication cream. 
3. IMPORTANT - DRINK LOTS OF WATER (8-10 GLASSES) 
4. Exercise regularly 
5.  Eat healthily (more vitamins) this can help with covering up the scars. 
Acne scars take up to months so you will have to practice this good habits everyday. Good Luck :) ,6,6,0
I have extremely oily skin that is horribly prone to blemishes. I can‚Äôt even attempt to wear foundation or any kind of make up on my skin in the warmer months because it just slides off of my face by mid day. 
The ONLY solution I have found is using Argan oil or jojoba oil as a moisturizer. I put it on immediately after showering when my skin is still damp and rub it in using circular motions. It‚Äôs safe to use around your eyes as well. It remains greasy for one or two minutes (enough time to brush my teeth) but it will eventually absorb into the skin leaving no trace of oiliness. This is the only way I can have a matte appearance without feeling like my skin is going to crack if I smile. It has also decreased the amount of outbreaks I have and started reducing the appearance of my acne scars.
I highly recommend giving either or both a try.

i have the same question as well. im prescribed with Locacid (a topical contains Tretinoin 0.05%) and Zapzyt (10% Benzoyl Peroxide gel) and after using both of these two, i noticed that there are some dry patches on my face (mainly on the cheeks and the jaws). therefore im looking for a moisturizer, many people recommend the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel (not the gel creme one) but the reviews on this one seem to be divided: some people love it, some people had bad experiences with it. ,2,2,0
I like to use the Simple Protecting Light moisturizer! It has SPF 15 in it so it's good for hyperpigmentation.,2,2,0

Sounds like your acne may be hormonal. When you‚Äôre with her, your hormones will fluctuate. That could be the trigger.,12,12,0
Yeah, it actually can. I've noticed that if other people touch your skin with their hands, hair or clothes, you skin can get irritated very easily. That's because there are bacteria being transmitted. If someone touches me I feel like my skin gets itchy or very dirty, so I don't let anyone to touch my skin. I feel like I'm being prisoned in bacterias that way. But this is on of the reasons that causes acne because ofcourse it dependes how your metabolism is working and how your organism is handling stress and deficienties of different vitamins. So yeah, I think what you've asked maybe is causing you a litte bit more breakouts than usual but still there are a variety of factors causing severe breakouts too.,2,2,0
Ask her what facial/hair products she‚Äôs using and check out the ingredients. If she‚Äôs using oils or anything comedogenic, that can be coming off on your face when y‚Äôall chill together,2,2,0
I‚Äôm pretty sure the foundation I was wearing was causing my boyfriend to break out. I stopped wearing it, and he stopped breaking out.,2,2,0
Ok just to let you know a lot of the time any acne around the chin is caused by hormones. Like a slight imbalance. Especially if most of your breakouts happen in the second half of your cycle. I know doctors say it has nothing to do With what you eat but I have had tremendous luck with taking different vitamins. Taking a zinc supplement has cleared my skin up completely in two months.

First off, you're 16. I know acne sucks, but at your age, it's to be expected. Don't sweat it too much until you still have acne when you're 25 and then okay maybe start to panic.

Second, I think you're being very harsh on your skin.  Showering twice a day is never necessary and is probably doing more harm than good.  I hope you aren't using that Benzoyl peroxide twice a day as well.  Showering twice a day and the BP will make your skin extremely dry (even if you are using lotion) and irritated, leading to more breakouts.  I would recommend showering once a day, use the BP once a day, and moisturize once or twice a day.  See how that works and report back in 90 days.,2,2,0

oh my, i dealt with the same thing on Yaz. it made my skin EXCELLENT but i ended up with debilitating migraines and migraine-associated vertigo that actually lead to me having to leave my job. I wasn‚Äôt able to put together that it was the Yaz doing it for years, and when I went off it the more severe migraines went away.

also, i don‚Äôt know if i can 100% attribute this to Yaz, but i also had terrible panic attacks on it. did you have any psychological side effects?

my OBGYN put me on tri-sprintec (i think a generic of ortho tri-cyclen?) and it helps my acne quite a bit. it doesn‚Äôt do as much as Yaz did, but it cuts down on the more painful cysts and thank god i‚Äôm not having 2+ life-ruining migraines a week.

i would consult your derm & OBGYN and see if there‚Äôs another BC you can try. imho clearer skin isn‚Äôt worth migraines. but i‚Äôve been able to find a happy medium and i hope you‚Äôre able to as well!

I had been on Generess Fe for several years before deciding that I needed to switch due to my acne still being an issue in my 20s. My doc put me on Tri Estarylla a few months ago and it seemed to help a bit but I still suffered from pretty bad hormonal chin acne towards the end of my pack. In the last month though, I have been having so many issues that I'm sure are related to the pill. Ive had heavy breakthrough bleeding (as much as a period) every single day for the past 45 days and my skin is horrendous, just as bad as before I started Accutane. I'm pretty distraught because it's all centered around my chin which indicates to me a hormonal issue, so my doctor wants to switch pills again, but I'm so scared my skin is going to just keep getting worse. Maybe I'll ask about Yaz. ,1,1,0
Agree basically with u/_industrialengineer_. Read about the tretinoin and ask your doctor any questions - but for most people it is by far the strongest and most effective medicine for acne. The key is that is just takes a while (like a couple months) for it to fully be in effect.,3,3,0
No. Start the Tretinoin  immediately, ill help you in a long run much faster. 

to ease the flaking and rediness, do a buffer.



MORNING: 

Panoxyl face wash  
moisturize and sunscreen     

--------
Evening:

Wash face with gentle cleaner, i suggest cerave foaming cleaner.  
Apply moisturizer, , i suggest Cerave PM  
wait 1-2 hours  
Apply the Tretinoin.

follow these steps for about 2-3 weeks.

Once your skin adjusted chnage the routine  

EVENING:
Wash face  
Wait 30-40min  
Apply Treinoin  
Wait 1 hour  
apply moisturizer

The stuff you read online about tretinoin being a "nightmare" are by people who didn't do any research and simply slather tret on their face.

I feel u guys, i used to have bad acne too.Just wanna share some things that really improve my acne till the point its 98% clear :) , im not an expert on this but i just wanna share my experience on what i did. 

Here is the list of things that did to have clear skin , everybody is different tho so i cant guarantee it will work for every one , but why not give it shot :)

Mind my grammar :)

Here are the list :

1.Stop being obsessed or stressed about your acne , it will actually make things worse and I also actually believed that Mental health and acne has some sort of correlation.

2.Stop looking in the mirror all the time, By not looking in the mirror all the time , you wont be obsessing how many spots you have.You will much happier trust me :).Put your time on other things that is more important !.

3.Stop picking/ touching your skin. this will only make your acne worse by spreading bacteria and gunk to your skin and causing scarring.You will see a big difference from not touching.

4.Change the way you sleep , especially your head position. Don't face your cheeks directly on your pillow this will only make things worse. Your skin needs to breathe !!

5.Change your pillow case  at least once a week 

6.Drink at least a gallon of water a day which is equivalent to 3 liters of water. By doing this on a regular basis , u will be constantly flushing out toxins , oil and junk out of your body. Urinating frequently is a good sign.

7.Watched out for your diet , especially foods that contains allergens.

1.Milk
2.Eggs

8.The way you washed your hair should be change , don't let the shampoo flow onto your face. Some shampoo's contains silicons and non comedogenic substance which will cause clogged pores. Instead try tilting your head down to wash your hair.


9. Try to not to wash you face with cleansers  , just water twice a day morning and night. By doing this your are not constantly stripping your acid mantle , which the mantle has a specific role to keep bad bacteria and harmful particles out.You could still used skin products after washing it with water but make sure that it is not harsh and does not contain any non comedogenic substance. Try more natural products 



10.Finally exfoliate your skin once a week , try investing on a cleansing brush as the process of removing the dead skin will be much faster. Try to avoid exfoliants with beads. After investing the cleansing brush use only water to exfoliate and not cleansers

The acne I tend to get behind and under (ear-jawline area) my ears tends to be cystic, it tends to be panful and swollen and doesn't come to a head, but it has in the past for me got so bad that it sort of burst itself (I was in a meeting, it was puss/blood, it was effing gross).

If this is what you're experiencing, I've not had any luck with over the counter treatments for these so I can't really offer any advice unfortunately, sorry about that!

For your back, try and find some kind of body wash with either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. You can buy an over the counter gel called Acnecide, or a prescribed alternative called Duac which is essentially the same but with antibiotics in, which you apply topically which should help on your back.

If you get the duac, make sure you wash your hands well and use a towel / t-shirt you don't mind ruining as it tends to have a bit of a bleaching effect. This it apparently not a problem if you wait for it to fully dry and wash your hands properly but my towels got mega bleached haha

good luck my dude!,2,2,0
Have you tried Jojoba Oil? It has the same claims and I use it every day but still have small break outs here and there. I was wondering if you've compared the two and find sunflower oil to be more effective for acne prone skin ,2,2,0
1.Skinceuticals Retinol 0.5 . It‚Äôs pricey, but overtime it fades the scars. I had back acne and I use that to dry out my acne that persists. I use it two to three times per week because it really dries out the skin. I usually apply it at night after my shower. My esthetician recommended it to me and I‚Äôve been using it for the last year. It works great, but like I said, it really dries out your skin after the second or third day you apply it. So not use it on your face even though it‚Äôs for the face. Your face will dry out and you‚Äôll look like you‚Äôre peeling. 
2. Good Genes by Sunday Riley. Again, pricey but definitely works. I use it on my face and it faded my dark acne scars/spots after 3 days of using it. Smells funny but it works. 3. Aloe Vera. You can buy it a the grocery store. The actual slime from the plant helps fade the acne scars. Good luck! ,3,3,0
Essential oils diluted in a carrier oil works well for me. You could try a few drops of tea tree oil in olive or almond oil and apply the blend twice a day on the affected areas.,0,0,0
I take birth control and Spironolactone. It doesn't stop the acne, but it definitely helps, especially if for chin and jawline acne. Also, I didn't gain weight while on the pill, I feel like that side effect is greatly exaggerated. It took me a few months to get real, REAL results, but I could see improvement after one month. ,1,1,0
tazorac - causes cell turn over rate to increase much faster thus shedding old skin and preventing clogged pores (breakouts)  

Aczone - kills acne bacteria.  

----
2 over the counter products that you can buy that does the same thing but not as powerful are 

Differin  and benzyol peroxide which replaces the tazorac and aczone respectively. 

If you wanna "wean" off Tazorac, I suggest you start using differen every other day. 


but of course, talk to your derm, that might find another solution that your insurance will cover.

I had the same problem at the beginning of September so I will throw in my two cents!

My doctor said it happens to many people when the seasons change, and she recommended I use an OTC anti-fungal on my face after I told her a DIY face mask of no sugar added yogurt ended up helping clear and calm my acne.

Essentially, it isn't "true" acne so it won't respond to acne medication. Even though they were pus-filled and looked identical to zits, it was actually overgrown yeast bacteria on my face (which is on your skin naturally) that was getting over exerted by the season changes.

I also now take a probiotic supplement and have a morning smoothie where I mix flax and castor oil in it which has significantly reduced my oil production and I currently have only one pimple left on my face - but that's my normal monthly chin zit thanks to lovely hormones :/,3,3,0
Could it be that your skin dries out as the weather cools? Less humidity? Dry skin is a huge irritant. It makes your face produce more oil which clogs pores along with dead skin. I would try a gently creamy moisturizing face wash, exfoliate with an aha, use a good moisturizer. Good luck!,3,3,0
In general the problem is below the layer where exfoliating will help, and too vigorous exfoliation can potentially make it worse or damage the skin generally. 

It could be related to sunshine levels (although the relationship between sunlight and acne isn't entirely clear), diet changes with winter, activity level changes, or other factors. To be honest the easiest thing to do would probably be to talk to your doctor or at least find an over the counter treatment strategy that works and just use it during that time period. ,2,2,0
my cystic acne always gets remarkably worse around early September. no clue what could trigger it, it's just a constant in my life I've sadly come to expect. ,2,2,0
I know they can be bad for you, but have you considered using a sunbed? Just once a week or something, so your skins getting the rays like it does in summer. I'm VERY pale so I'm hesitant to use one myself, but I've heard from a lot of people that they help to clear you up. ,1,1,0
I feel u guys, i used to have bad acne too.Just wanna share some things that really improve my acne till the point its 98% clear :) , im not an expert on this but i just wanna share my experience on what i did. 

Here is the list of things that did to have clear skin , everybody is different tho so i cant guarantee it will work for every one , but why not give it shot :)

Mind my grammar :)

Here are the list :

1.Stop being obsessed or stressed about your acne , it will actually make things worse and I also actually believed that Mental health and acne has some sort of correlation.

2.Stop looking in the mirror all the time, By not looking in the mirror all the time , you wont be obsessing how many spots you have.You will much happier trust me :).Put your time on other things that is more important !.

3.Stop picking/ touching your skin. this will only make your acne worse by spreading bacteria and gunk to your skin and causing scarring.You will see a big difference from not touching.

4.Change the way you sleep , especially your head position. Don't face your cheeks directly on your pillow this will only make things worse. Your skin needs to breathe !!

5.Change your pillow case  at least once a week 

6.Drink at least a gallon of water a day which is equivalent to 3 liters of water. By doing this on a regular basis , u will be constantly flushing out toxins , oil and junk out of your body. Urinating frequently is a good sign.

7.Watched out for your diet , especially foods that contains allergens.

1.Milk
2.Eggs
3.Fish (e.g., bass, flounder, cod)
4.Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, shrimp)
5.Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, pecans)
6.Peanuts
7.Wheat
8.Soybeans

You need to add probiotics to your diet - whether that's taking a supplement or drinking kombucha daily, or the like.

Your skin is host to a multitude of microbes. The antibiotics killed certain bacteria on your skin, causing other bacteria to take over in the pore. Look into putting an anti-fungal cream on your face, because it sounds like the "yeast" bacteria has become dominate, and it doesn't respond to acne medication since it's not technically 'acne' (for me I went the cheap route and bought $6 no sugar added, full fat yogurt).

Good luck! From what I've been noticing, a lot of adult acne isn't actually acne but fungal in nature. ,1,1,0
Same thing happened to me. I was on antibiotics after wisdom teeth surgery and my skin completely went to shit after that, breaking out in small pimples and cysts and redness/dry skin everywhere. It was horrid, long story short I went to the derm and she prescribed me topical clindamycin phosphate.

I‚Äôve been on it for a month now, I know it takes longer to see complete results! But I‚Äôm doing much better. I have less bumps on my cheeks and forehead, no more large cyst-like acne, and my oily skin has calmed down a bit. I still have lots of scars from the acne because I waited so long to see a derm since I thought it was just hormonal acne or my diet but thats the least of my worries, the active pimples were the worst. Go see a derm! And get checked out for allergies to the antibiotic you took maybe? My rash ended up spreading to my back and neck, so we suspected an allergic reaction to penicillin. Best of luck!,1,1,0
Yes, avoid all whey! Dairy can be a cause of breakouts. Vega makes a great protein powder, you can get ones that have greens and other vitamins added as well, or just the plain protein powder. Hemp protein is also pretty decent.,3,3,0
You could try soy based protein.,1,1,0
Seconding the hemp protein, it‚Äôs one of the best in my Pinyan,1,1,0
I gave up dairy and had to drop my gold standard whey in accordance. I switched to Hemp protein. Note that Hemp protein is slow digesting though. ,1,1,0
Plant fusion protein powder. Shit tastes so good and it has no whey in it ,1,1,0

Have you looked into AHA/BHA‚Äôs? Alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids are wonderful at exfoliating skin and helping to remove the marks. BHA‚Äôs I believe are a little better because they actually clean out the pores as well as renewing skin. Just make sure you‚Äôre doing what you can to treat any new breakouts, hormonal acne sucks. I‚Äôve had to get on a medication called spirolactone to prevent new breakouts. But so far it‚Äôs helped me. Good luck to you!,1,1,0
Is it pink/red? If you put a glass over it (blanch it) does it disappear? If yes, it might actually be PIE not PIH (hyper pigmentation.) This is more likely if the marks are leftover from acne.

Either way, spf 50 sunscreen is the way to go.,1,1,0
I highly recommend using SPF 30 or higher every day, even if it's not sunny or warm, every single day! Protecting the skin is so important. I've found a big improvement in my skin since adding this into my skincare regime.,1,1,0
My esthetician recommended Peter thomas roth's sunscreen powder and it really helped with preventing sunburn this past summer. 

To lighten hyperpigmentation I swear by AHA/BHA wipes as well as anything with turmeric in it!!

I've been on a spironolactone and doxycycline for a year. I had persistent hormonal acne five years after accutane.


My experience has been great. My acne was significant reduced by the third month and unnoticeable by the sixth month. The only issue I faced and still do is frequent urination, but I manage. No side effects otherwise. ,1,1,0
Great medicine for hormonal acne. Helps make oily skin so manageable ,1,1,0
I saw noticeable improvement at 2 months, about 70% gone at 5 months. No purging. I wasn't using Differin though.,1,1,0
My dermatologist told me that the first month of accutane would make you breakout more as your body gets used to the drugs. She paired it with antibiotics to lessen it. You should be fine after a month. I started noticing a major difference after 2 months but that was after I had the dosage raised,1,1,0
It can definitely take a few weeks to see really good results. If you are in doubt I would just give your dermatologist a call. Here is a pretty good [scientific review].(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835909/#R50)

Some parts about delayed initial response:
> When macrocomedones are not the cause of poor response, the dosage of isotretinoin should be carefully considered as some patients will suffer a deterioration in their acne at the start of a course of isotretinoin.50 If the poor response or worsening acne is thought to be due to an early post isotretinoin flare which is well reported, an antibiotic can be used in combination with isotretinoin such as erythromycin 1 g daily or trimethoprim 200‚Äì300 mg b.d.50 Tetracyclines should be avoided in combination with isotretinoin due to a possible increased risk of benign intracranial hypertension.51

> If the acne is very inflammatory, then a significant reduction in the dose of isotretinoin and addition of oral steroids may be required (e.g. 0.5‚Äì1.0 mg/kg/day for 2‚Äì3 weeks). In other patients it may be appropriate to increase the dose of isotretinoin providing that the side effects are tolerated.

The takeaway there is that for most people there is a bit of a flare, but for some people where the response it worse either antibiotics, steroids, or other medicines may be added to help reduce some of the startup problems with isotretinoin. The best move is probably just to let your doctor know what's going on and see what they recommend.,1,1,0
It took me a few months to see results. It gave me bad breakouts at first, like the worst I'd ever had. It made my skin peel too so I look seriously disgusting for a while.. buut then my skin cleared up so it was all good. It takes a few months for medication to really settle into your system. At least that's what my doc told me. ,1,1,0
It‚Äôs pretty frustrating that you go on meds to try and eliminate a problem, but it gets worse before it gets better. I am noticing that The dark spots that used to be on my checks where I had a breakout are fading so I think that‚Äôs a good sign. It‚Äôs just the new bumps that are coming that are the problem. Does anyone have advice on how to lessen the inflammation? ,1,1,0
Wow, congrats! Wish I was finishing my treatment. Day 25 and not feeling great about the lack of progress. ,1,1,0
Differin now has an OTC variant. What‚Äôs your current routine?,1,1,0
Chin acne is normally hormonal. Are you on the pill or any hormonal contraception? 

,1,1,0
Are you using anything for your acne?,1,1,0
DO NOT GO AGAINST THE GRAIN! shave with the grain and use a two or three blade razor, any more razors just irritates the skin more, and get a shaving cream for sensitive skin. Shave as often as you can. If your beard is thick enough shave every day, I shave every other day because my beard isn't that think. The longer your hair is when you shave the more it pulls on your hairs and also irritates your skin.,1,1,0
Absolutely. Why do you think we get no acne before puberty and then once our teenage years arrive we start to suddenly break out? Because of our hormone levels skyrocketing and messing with our skin's sebum/oil production and follicles etc. Hormones are pretty much always involved in acne though.

As the problem is coming from within your body, not from the outside, touching your face or not really won't make much of a difference.  Using BP is always a good place to start. Depending on the severity of your acne and whether the BP works or not you may want to see a doctor or a dermatologist to get a prescription only treatment such as topical retinoids, oral or topical antibiotics or accutane. 

But yeah long story short it is hormonal and is a normal part of being a teen so don't let anyone tell you that it's because you're dirty/unhygienic, have a bad diet or are in anyway unhealthy. I advise you to ignore all of the shite advice you get here about having to eat restrictively, constantly wash your bedding and never touching your own face.,5,5,0

Unfortunately you have to be so strict with your diet, it controls everything in your body. A year ago I managed to get my severe acne under control and the scars were starting to subside, then a few weeks ago my skin erupted with massive cystic acne, the only change to my diet was coffee, I stopped drinking coffee for over a year and only recently started drinking it again, as soon as I stopped my acne subsided again...hopefully it stays that way.

Sounds like a lot of your products are acne centered, which is great until you put them all together. Ultimately I think It can do more harm then good, if I were you I'd try and cut out some stuff. I'm glad your going to a dermatologist, but ultimately... you know to stop messing with those spots. The derm is going to tell you that. Try and let it go when they puff up again (i had cystic acne, it's easy to say and almost impossible to do..i know.) And just wait to see the doctor. ,1,1,0
Any suggestions on how to treat this? It feels almost bubbly and I've tried treating it for about 2 months. ,1,1,0
2 months? What have you done to treat it? Could be a cyst. ,1,1,0
Stop any product your using. Oh. AVOID the sun, and if you can't, apply sunblock. Sun exposure = red marks will become redder = delayed healing. Easy to prevent. 

Still not convinced? Notice how your skin is also very fair. That sounds good, but your skin is A LOT more sensitive to UV rays compared to a darker skinned person, because they have more melanin, which is our bodies' natural sunblock. So you should be taking extra care of that precious and beautiful skin you have from the sun!

Now, you need something to cleanse the bacteria, dust, dirt that your face may accumulate throughout the day. I'm not going to recommend anything SPECIFIC, but you need to make sure of a few things. 

1- It's non-comedogenic. NO ingredients must have a comedogenic rating of 3 or above. (Example of comedogenic ingredient: Sodium Laureth Sulfate)

2- No fragrance. It causes irritation and is unnecessary. If a smell of a product bothers you, just have to deal with it. We're here to clear our face, not make it smell like a flower.

3- Only gentle products. Stay away from scrubs, exfoliating creams, foaming washes, etc. These are harsh on the skin!

4- Don't be so extra. You don't need a face mask, peelings, lasers, etc.

Next, is a treatment.

(I know I mentioned this) - The best treatment is sunblock. Why? Because this pigmentation actually naturally heals. It's not there forever. Pigmentation is not like scarring, and CAN be completely cured. The sun is what can make it worse. Prevention is better than only treating.

Now, if you can handle that. Let's go into stuff that will assist you for sure. 

- Vitamin C serum (This stuff works awesome. I use the Mad Hippie company one. It's a little pricey ($20-$27) but it has AMAZING ingredients and actives that are designed to make your skin better. Great reviews as well. But there's a lot more companies if you're on a low budget!)

- Jojoba/Rosehip oil (I think this is almost VITAL! Your skin needs MOISTURE! Instead of using creams filled with chemicals and sketchy ingredients, go with either jojoba, rosehip, or even... a mixture of both oils together! Whatever you like. Not ONLY do they moisturize your skin, they also can TREAT your redness and irritation!!! Look them up and you'll throw that chemical crap in the garbage!)
Both these oils have a comedogenic rating of 2 which is satisfactory. A few drops cover the entire face, and it won't break you out unless you're being excessive. Even then, there's a low chance.

- No dairy! - It's simple science. Dairy raises IGF-1 levels. Like, by a... That's not good for us suffering with skin issues. Are you intaking any dairy? Completely abandon it or cut it down to minimum.

- I would suggest more, but it would just make your skin even more sensitive and would take time to adjust. Stick to a clean and simple routine now, focused primarily on prevention. 
Good luck.

Use Clinique cleanser (pink),Paula's choice resist weightless toner with Shiseido cotton, sebamed clear face gel for moisturizer & Clinique 50 spf mineral sunscreen and grape seed oil occasionally at night & nexcare acne patches. Only use benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid as a spot treatment no more than twice a week. And after your skin calms down do manual exfoliation with a brush no harsh scrubs (MUST wash tone moisturizer twice a day and protect in morning with spf)

Of course eat healthy see if there are any triggering foods in your diet. Keep hormones balanced Keep stress level low and get a good amount of sleep. Enjoy your life do something you love. Use paper towels to dry your face after washing. Change pillow case every two days and wash bed sheets and covers once a week. Keep hair and hair products away from your face and check if detergent you wash clothes with can be irritating you. 

Use cosdna.com & beautypedia.com to analyze ingredients on all your products you own and plan on buying. ,2,2,0
First of all, definitely look at a good dermatologist if it‚Äôs allowed in your budget. No one knows your skin better than you and a dermatologist, because of this most people will give you ‚Äúadvice‚Äù that‚Äôs often based on their experience, but not yours. You need something tailored to you.
If you can‚Äôt get a derm, or don‚Äôt have time, here‚Äôs my suggestions:

Your acne could be *hormonal* as was mine, so try to find a trigger. Maybe diet and/or stress. Even dental issues can cause breakouts. That was my experience, my acne was from the inside-out. I found that no amount of topical product eliminated the root cause until I got on birth control, antibiotics, then spirolactone. My diet and stress were what initially triggered my issue in my early twenties; a verbally abusive supervisor and the stress of college. It was also hereditary; mom had cystic, and she got that from my grandfather. During his time, derms suggested uv lamps, now he‚Äôs battling skin cancer. I‚Äôll get to SPF in a minute.

If you have a lot of redness, it‚Äôs temporary. For me, my cysts calmed when I took Advil, iced my cysts, and drank plenty of water. AHA‚Äôs and BHA‚Äôs are fantastic at speeding up healing of hyper-pigmentation.  (Paula‚Äôs Choice has a great line, and so does The Ordinary via Beautylish) *DO NOT* over do it though. Only exfoliate a couple times a week, or less.
Be gentle‚Äîdo not use hard, abrasive products. Try your best not to pop or pick. If you have a large cyst, buying those clearasil covers will help speed healing.

A summary:

-Definitely invest in high SPF, get some sun, but very limited. 
-Take vitamin d3 (if suggested from a doctor)
-Retin-a 
-Reduce diary
-Reduce stress
-Improve diet if you haven‚Äôt already (you may have a impeccable diet and may still have acne)
-Plenty of water
-Birth control
-Antibiotics
-Spirolactone (can help unwanted facial hair too)
-AHA/BHA‚Äôs (will help unclog pores and speed clearing of redness)
-Vitamin C (use after AHA/BHA to further help pigmentation)
-Advil (for new cysts that are fairly deep in the skin)
-Acne spot treatment covers (Clearasil is one brand)

-Accutane, if all else fails. This is a last resort due to the risks. 

I wish you the best. You‚Äôre beautiful and this is temporary. <3,1,1,0
I feel u girl , i used to have bad acne too.Just wanna share some things that really improve my acne till the point its 98% clear :) , im not an expert on this but i just wanna share my experience on what i did.

Here is the list of things that did to have clear skin , everybody is different tho so i cant guarantee it will work for every one , but why not give it shot :)

Mind my grammar :)

Here are the list :

1.Stop being obsessed or stressed about your acne , it will actually make things worse and I also actually believed that Mental health and acne has some sort of correlation.

2.Stop looking in the mirror all the time, By not looking in the mirror all the time , you wont be obsessing how many spots you have.You will much happier trust me :).Put your time on other things that is more important !.

3.Stop picking/ touching your skin. this will only make your acne worse by spreading bacteria and gunk to your skin and causing scarring.You will see a big difference from not touching.

4.Change the way you sleep , especially your head position. Don't face your cheeks directly on your pillow this will only make things worse. Your skin needs to breathe !!

5.Change your pillow case  at least once a week 

6.Drink at least a gallon of water a day which is equivalent to 3 liters of water. By doing this on a regular basis , u will be constantly flushing out toxins , oil and junk out of your body. Urinating frequently is a good sign.

7.Watched out for your diet , especially foods that contains allergens.

1.Milk
2.Eggs
3.Fish (e.g., bass, flounder, cod)
4.Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, shrimp)
5.Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, pecans)
6.Peanuts
7.Wheat
8.Soybeans


8.The way you washed your hair should be change , don't let the shampoo flow onto your face. Some shampoo's contains silicons and non comedogenic substance which will cause clogged pores. Instead try tilting your head down to wash your hair.


9. Try to not to wash you face with cleansers  , just water twice a day morning and night. By doing this your are not constantly stripping your acid mantle , which the mantle has a specific role to keep bad bacteria and harmful particles out.You could still used skin products after washing it with water but make sure that it is not harsh and does not contain any non comedogenic substance. Try more natural products 



10.Finally exfoliate your skin once a week , try investing on a cleansing brush as the process of removing the dead skin will be much faster. Try to avoid exfoliants with beads. After investing the cleansing brush use only water to exfoliate and not cleansers

Mornings - Bathe and rinse my face with mild to cold water 

Night - Bathe and rinse my face with mild to cold water and apply my favorite vitamin c serum

Are you thinking of the kind with extractions? I got them for maybe 4 months a row... I have mixed feelings ,1,1,0
I tried it for like four months before. It was alright. There were some results, bu don't expect it to clear your skin completely. ,1,1,0
Are you moisturizing with an oil free and hypoallergenic facial lotion? Also track your food intake and see if you can find any correlation with irritants like dairy and sugar. I recommend keeping your hair off your face and washing it regularly at this age too. Change your pillow sheets as often as possibly. At your age it is usually hormonal and will go away but I understand how awful having it can be ,2,2,0
I have tried antibiotics but they did bugger all, but I know people who've had success with them. Go to the dr-they'll probably prescribe antibiotics at first. If those don't work you'll probably be referred to a dermatologist. Or just ask for a dermatology appointment straight away as this isn't really the GP's area. ,1,1,0

Although minocycline is pretty safe, you are right it does have some scary side effects. I would talk to your dermatologist again - there are other great topical options like retinoids. Maybe just give them a call and explain that you are uncomfortable starting with the minocycline and would like to try something else first. 

They work a bit more slowly but can be even more powerful than topical antibiotics ultimately. 

Sounds like you are also making some great dietary changes. Although I would say drink as much water as you are thirsty for but you don't need to make a point of drinking a certain amount.,2,2,0
To be fully honest with you, I'm on Minocycline right now and my doctor never told me about any side effects. I haven't noticed a thing. I was on it before too. It really helps me.,2,2,0
I‚Äôd recommend taking it if you have any cysts or inflammation. I did, and Minocycline helped a lot. Once you‚Äôre cleared up you can try weaning off and seeing how it goes?

In my experience dermatologists seem to use antibiotics as the stepping stone before accutane, which I‚Äôm ok with because that stuff is way more scary.,1,1,0
My acne always comes back after I go off of antibiotics but my skin was grey while on it. Take probiotics while you‚Äôre on! It will mess up your stomach bacteria and don‚Äôt make the mistake of not eating before taking it I‚Äôve run out of class and vomited ,1,1,0
Great question - I would start by talking to your primary care doctor. Hormone imbalances can affect or cause acne but in general they can be managed by an experienced family medicine or other primary care doctor. They can also help decide if endocrinology makes the most sense, versus for example a gynecologist who would have more experience treating things like PCOS.,2,2,0
The fact that spiro works so well for acne is testament to the fact that it's a hormonal problem and not caused by food sensitivities/poor diet, gut problems, touching your face too much, dirty pillows or any of that codswallop.,29,29,0

This is me. 19 years old guy, currently studying Marketing in Denmark. Before i came to Denmark as seen in this picture, i had somewhat clear skin. I ate shit - dairy, sugars, soda - you name it. I didnt change my pillows, didnt drink enough water a day, whatever that makes you break out. Ive had abit of acne since 14, but it is kinda periodic - during summers i have barely anything on my face.

During first months in Denmark, i slowly realised that my acne was coming back. What i also noticed is that my facial skin is very very oily every day, i was producing excess sebum oil that was causing acne.
I started working out regularly( 3x a week gym, 1-2x running 5km each, 10km a day with bicycle to school). That didnt fix the situation. I read alot of articles about diet. That was exactly 1 week ago when i cut out all sugars(cookies,icecream,soda,etc), all white bread and pastries and all dairy. Started eating alot of vegetables and fruits, atleast a serving or two a day- carrots, tomatoes, broccoli, cucumber, 2bananas a day,mango, 2 apples a day, pineapple, pears. Drinking 2L of water every day, eating alot of oats also.

This is me now - 1,5months later and 1 week after i cut out all dairy.
https://imgur.com/a/AUOTM
You cant see in the pic, but i have lots of jaw and neck acne also. Most of it goes from temples to jaw.

Been changing my sheets very often. Washing my face twice a day, using moisturizer Seebium H20 and sebium global acne prone skin cream. I do not touch my face and any pimples, i do not use hands to wash my face, rather i use the shower head. I change my towels once a week.
What am i doing wrong? Maybe those sugars in fruits are breaking me out? Maybe it is just too much worrying and stress? I would be happy to do anything more to just fix my self-insecurity problem.

p.s. - that cigarette behind my ear in the picture is a joke/troll to my friend. I dont smoke or use any alcohol.,2,2,0
I would cut down on the fruit to maybe 1-2 pieces a day. Also are you eating any healthy fats? If you're not getting enough omega 3/6 in your diet that could cause an imbalance. Try adding in some avocados, nuts, flax seed etc.,2,2,0
I think it's the cigarette in the ear,2,2,0
It sounds like you‚Äôre being very proactive in finding a solution! I know it‚Äôs hard trying to identify what has triggered a big change in your skin. 

Since you‚Äôre taking good care of your skin, getting plenty of exercise, eating well and drinking lots of water, my thought is that this could be stress related - you just moved, you‚Äôre in school, and now the added stress caused by breakouts can lead to more breakouts!  

My suggestion would be to develop a skincare routine and stick with it for at least a few months. Looks like you have a cleanser and a topical treatment. Do you also have a moisturizer? It‚Äôs counterintuitive, but oily skin can be tamed with a good moisturizer. I like CereVe PM. Weekly sheet masks are another great way to get some extra moisture into your skin. You should also use a sunscreen every day.   Make sure you‚Äôre cleansing your skin as soon as possible after working out - face wipes will work in a pinch - to remove sweat and dirt that accumulates with exercise. ,1,1,0
You are very cute and don't have much in the way of acne imo. If you're 19 any acne you do have can be chalked up to typical adolescent/young adult hormone levels. ,1,1,0
You da real MVP. I'm curious to see if the effects will show up (if there are any) that quickly.,2,2,0
What's the supposed effect of soy milk in acne? Does it worsen it?,2,2,0
If you do have some sort of reaction, you won't be able to identify the culprit. Gotta isolate your variables, man. ,2,2,0
Well, I can't see a difference. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø,2,2,0
Remember 1. It‚Äôs NEVER as bad as you think, no matter what! 2. You don‚Äôt want someone in your life who won‚Äôt accept you 3. As soon as you step out of the house, there‚Äôs nothing you can do besides carrying makeup. Forget about it and enjoy yourself. 4. Dark restaurants can be your friend if you‚Äôre really concerned ,7,7,0
Everything said before, plus, your comfort level with him will grow with time. Wear makeup if that ups your confidence now, because first dates are nerve wracking as is. As you get more comfortable around him or whoever you date in the future, makeup becomes less of a priority.

I struggle with acne too and one thing that has helped me with my boyfriend is slowly dropping hints of my skincare routine. Snapping him with a mask on or being excited about a new product or whatever it was. And also denying ice cream because dairy makes me break out, or making sure I have backup face wash and moisturiser at his place. He's probably oblivious to be honest but I know that I've conveyed I take care of myself and some factors are just harder to manage than others. I know that even on my worst breakouts he's never going to think that I just haven't washed my face or whatever, because he knows I try, and there's no judgement there. It takes time to get comfortable with people about anything. This is just one more thing and you'll be fine.

+ good luck and have fun on your date üòä,2,2,0

I have to say, it will definetly get worse if you pop it, which it looks like you have. Leave it alone. What products are you using now? ,3,3,0

Epiduo is so harsh. It took, in all honesty, two months for me to adjust. Every time I put it on my skin started peeling. I used it every three days, then two days, so on. Just a little dab before bed, then wait until it dries and use a moisturizer. But I will say, that stuff works. I've gotten two spots since I started, it just took a while. ,2,2,0

Accutane is a big deal. There‚Äôs no getting around that. There are serious risks and serious possibility of reward.  You should read all the information you can on it, including opinions from people who have taken it. 

If you have exhausted all other efforts, including antibiotics/medications, skincare routine, diet, etc, and are still having bad breakouts, then accutane might be the right decision for you. 

I‚Äôve taken it twice, once at 23 and again at 26. My experiences were wildly different, so acccutane experiences vary not only from person to person but from each time you may take it. To answer about effectiveness, yes, accutane is the only medication that is capable of ‚Äúcuring‚Äù your acne, even after you‚Äôve stopped taking it. In my case, my acne was VERY severe and my doctor was upfront with me that I should expect to take at least two rounds of it. Sure enough, in a couple of years I felt it was bad enough (though not as bad as the first time I took it) to do another round. 

The side effects can be intense. The first time I took it, I was sooo dry everywhere - lips, face, eyes, body. I coated myself in moisturizer and never left the house without chapstick and eyedrops. I also had regular nose bleeds and my skin, being very thin and fragile, would get cut and scraped easily. The second time, I had almost no issues with dryness, but I had much more intense joint pain and while it didn‚Äôt stop me from working out/being active, it definitely took a toll on my body. Both times I was very sensitive to the sun (I arranged for the bulk of my courses to take place in winter for that reason). The nice thing is that these side effects are temporary. They all go away once you‚Äôve completed your course. 

My skin is clear now, though I have some pitted scarring. Accutane was definitely the right decision for me. 

Talk to your doctor, your parents, your friends who may have taken it. Do your research, and understand that accutane is a serious medication that will take a pretty big hold on your life while you‚Äôre taking it, but that it does have the potential to make your life so much better! ,3,3,0

I‚Äôve used both the mask and pen light. I didn‚Äôt find either of them to be effective at all. I gave the mask the whole month until the controller ‚Äúran out,‚Äù and didn‚Äôt repurchase because smelling my breath behind that thing every day was annoying as hell for no results. I gave the pen 2 month. Got nothing. Thumbs down.,1,1,0
I've tried it until the controller ran out. I think my pimples reduced in size and my face was less red. My acne came back/didn't change that much after anyways. Its probably best suited for mild to moderate acne.,1,1,0
I think it's worthwhile. If I didn't have cystic acne, I could count on the mask to take care of most of my pimples. I notice that the light therapy mask helps my regular nodules come to a head quicker. ,1,1,0
You should call your derm and ask if there‚Äôs something you can use in the meantime. A serum with retinol should help. You could try using Differin as a spot treatment. They both help me a little with my cystic acne. Also, keep in mind that whatever you do start using might make your skin purge before it starts clearing up. ,1,1,0

I dont know if this will help but I use a chemical exfoliant (Cosrx BHA) and it tones it down but my stress levels are quite high so they don't completey disappear. But its significantly less now,2,2,0
Have you ever tried a retinoid?  Something like OTC differin.,1,1,0
I've tried just about everything under the sun, and while my acne has gotten a lot better, I'm 23, and really ready to just be done with this. I'm not sure if my skin is bad enough at the moment to justify accutane.

Cetaphil gentle cleanser
Adapelene .3
Cetaphil moisturizer 

PM
Cetaphil gentle cleanser
Benzaclin (benzoyl peroxide + clindamyacin)

I‚Äôd go straight to curology.,2,2,0
I‚Äôve tried both curology and the OTC Differin for a couple months each. So far I‚Äôve seen more improvement from the Differin in terms of new acne. Curology has had the benefit of lightening some of my old scars but hasn‚Äôt had as noticeable of an effect on new acne occurring. I‚Äôm still on Curology, but am thinking of switching back to Differin at the end of this month‚Äôs supply. 


You can get a free one month trial of Curology, so I‚Äôd probably start that one first. If it doesn‚Äôt work for you, then I would move to Differin. Good luck! ,1,1,0

I was in similar boat as you. Only I was on Diane35 (heavy duty birth control for acne). I went to see a dermatologist for the first time last month (I'm 30) and decided to just jump the gun and go on accutane because I'm tired of waiting around trying new things that don't work. My derm is a big accutane enthusiast and she didn't even suggest it but I did. ,3,3,0

What's your current routine?

Schedule appointment with a derm but they'll probably tell you the exact same thing i'm going to tell you

wash your face  
wait 15 min  
apply 2.5% Benzol peroxide ALL OVER, not just on the spots.  
Wait 15-30min  
Apply moisturizer  and sunscreen 

Derm might give you some antibotics and tretinoin too ,5,5,0
Derm in 2 and a half months I've tried an antibiotic called doxycycline and a cream with peroxyde. My routine is on point tbh .I'm just now on minocyline and it feels less agressive but that may just be psychological. My main goal is too control it till I'm described accutane in December üòí,2,2,0
Oil cleansing, moisturizing twice a day (hualuronic acid gel and heavy moisturizer mixed with jojoba oil), Retinol 1%, AHA 30% + BHA 2% and Lactic acid 10%, all from The Ordinary. This helped with scars and PIE too. I avoid products with alcohol, parfume, sulfates, essential oil and other comedogenic/irritating ingridients. I never use a foaming/gel cleanser since it dries out my skin, I prefer ‚Äúwashing‚Äù my face with an alcohol-free toner after oil clenasing.

I don‚Äôt eat dairy anymore and reduced my sugar income, but I like taking zinc, D3 and omega3 supplements. I am now 97% acne free, I still get a pimple now and then if I ate too much chocolate (sometimes I really can‚Äôt resist), but it is very rare nowadays which is such an improvement since I got new acne literally every day just a few months ago. I think switching to more gentle products was the biggest help. ,9,9,0
The biggest change for me came from getting myself out of a bad spot in life. I was living with dangerous, unstable people in a filthy, rundown house. I was always stressed and therefore picking at my face. I also couldn't keep my clothes, towels or bedding clean because our washer/dryer was broken and my anxiety/depression kept me from going to a laundry mat. Probably an abnormal answer, but this caused the biggest change/domino effect for me.,7,7,0
I've pretty much gotten rid of all my active acne by using salicylic acid followed by benzoyl peroxide twice daily and niacinamide serum to reduce inflammation and help with PIH. BP is the most important for me though, couldn't imagine doing my routine without it.,3,3,0

- Spironolactone
- BCP

Differin gel in evening to unclog pores. Azelaic acid in morning to zap bacteria. Both work well synergistically although I wouldn't combine the two until you've been on Differin once a day for a month, as it may tip you over the edge to eye-wateringly irritated skin (I speak from experience). ,2,2,0
1. Benzoylperoxide 10% twice a day without ever skipping or I get bad acne straight away

2. Salicylic acid 2% twice a day

3. Moisturizer

No gluten, no dairy, barely any sugar, 1L of water, Vitamin D and B 3/6

Do you shave and how often and what kind of razor? The more often to shave the better, I shave every other day because my facial hair doesn't come in very thick. Use gentle shaving cream and a two or three blade razor, any more blades are pointless and just irritate the skin more. I notice if I skip just one day my acne breaks out a little bit. My thought is that the hair catches dust and dirt and helps clog your pores.,1,1,0

Prefer drinking enough water for proper removal of waste products that will allow your skin to clean up most of the waste products that may be the reason for acne formation. Wash your face alternatively in intervals.

There certainly may be some role for vitamins in skin care, but in general for people in resource rich societies eating well rounded diets I would say the research I have seen so far is weak. Your body is pretty good even in the wild at holding on to most of the vitamins it needs, so I expect that major deficiencies would be rare. 

That said the macronutrient composition of your diet and things like how many empty carbohydrates you eat, or things that affect hormones, may play a much larger role. Sadly we don't understand that entirely either. 

I guess that was all a long winded way of saying I think that the Murad vitamins probably won't make much difference, and they are mostly selling marketing hype. If someone has evidence to the contrary I would be very curious to look into it. ,1,1,0
Hi there! I'm a 25yo lady, started having bd breakouts on my forehead and cheeks december last year when I was 24. I've done a lot of research and I'm sure Reddit will give you other answers but from my experience I would urge you to NOT take medication for your acne unless it's super severe. Most medications aim to stop the oil production in your skin after purging the shit out of you for months, causing you to dry out, get achy muscles and joints, experience fatigue, etc so that the oil glands for lack of a better word shrivel up and aren't susceptible to getting dirty and infected. That however can cause future breakouts to be much worse. 
A basic rule of thumb is to heal from the inside out. With adult acne, foods that you used to be ok with might not sit well anymore! Reason being your liver, kidneys, stomach, colon etc process things differently after adolescence so even without a diet change this can happen...Happened to me lol. 
General zones for acne have the forehead relating to digestion or the gastrointestinal tract. Add water, include more alkalizing foods, take more fiber to poop better or what I found to work for me is 2-4T of Bragg's apple cider vinegar in 8oz of water taken 15m before main meals. This helps lubricate and dilate your colon to process foods better...THIS was the biggest god send for me, but I know it's different for everyone. Would caution against using it as toner like some people!
Temples and eyebrows are usually from dehydration.  Center forehead or between eyebrows relates to your liver, food intolerance or allergies, or sensitivity to alcohol, caffeine and sugary drinks. Avoid or reduce!
Chin and jawline tend to be hormonal. Avoid foods that spike your hormones like tofu. To help regulate, teas are wonderful like lemon balm for stress. Supplements like evening primrose oil and fish oil (6000mg each a day for maximum efficiency, yes it's a lot and tiring), are good for both collagen regrowth to prevent scars or heal them quicker, and also help to naturally regulate hormones. 
Cheeks are also hormonal but for me they are related to lungs, stress, overeating, or touching things like side sleeping on your pillowcase of your arm. Excess build up of sebum there is no bueno. Try sleeping on your back, relaxing and regulating your nutrition intake. 

There will be a lot of acne maps that tell you different things, but what I listed is sort of what I found to be crossovers and commonalities in the maps. As I said before, heal from the inside out! Your body is processing things differently and the toxins it can't handle are now being expelled through your skin. I can't speak to the breakout on your back but i imagine if you drink more water, add an abundance of leafy greens to your daily diet, introduce ACV, test cutting foods like sugar, red meats, dairy, caffeine weekly to narrow down your triggers, and DON'T POP ANY PIMPLES! Cleanse, tone and moisturize twice daily with something without sulfates that strip your skin of oils. Find things with PURE vitamin c to add to your gentle moisturizer to help with scara and calm redness. This will sting a little but don't worry.

Source: Try Salima Skin Solutions for good cleansing tips and natural products especially if you're a POC. Or my favourite that I wish I found MONTHS ago, Banish Acne. 
I recommend acting NOW. It isn't worth it to wait and see if it gets worse cause it will and chances are this will be a lifelong battle that you can't heal, but can manage ;) Banish is wonderful and their products aim to trick the body into healing itself.
Again these topical things only do half the battle, diet and lifestyle change are the bulk of it and it's very important!

Good luck and stick to a routine, trust it and be healthy! Took 7mos on SSS for results and dealing with scars, Banish is my baby. Though I wish I did banish from the start, I'm using both now!

Hey Chuck, I'm sorry to hear about your acne problem. I'm working with a group of Stanford students on a startup to help people with acne. Would you be willing to chat with me so I can get the perspective of someone in your situation?,2,2,0
I am very sorry to hear that is happening to you, but it is definitely a very common experience. 

There are definitely a few good options for people in your general situation to discuss with a doctor. If you can't afford to do that in person you can check out telemedicine options like our app, Curology, other other similar services that are usually much more affordable.

I can't offer specific advice about your case but in general people may also consider things like over the counter Differin gel which is a weaker version of something dermatologists often prescribe, but still a pretty great medicine for a lot of people. It is a class of called topical retinoid that helps a lot of people with acne if they use it consistently. It is usually about $20. ,1,1,0
Hey man, after a year of doxycycline I became resistant to that. I then went to minocycline which worked a treat for another year, then it stopped working. I then went back to doxy for about 8 months and it worked really well again. Now I'm back on minocycline. My doctor told me that you just have to have a break from one then you can take it again. And also go see your gp or derm, no point taking it if it's clearly not working like it used to! (That's the mistake I made) ,2,2,0
Yup, I built up resistance to it within months. Resistance is something your body can use to save your life, but it also makes it a total bitch to find skincare solutions that work.

I become resistant to treatments very quickly, so Accutane became my last option. ,1,1,0
hey there fellow inhabitant of Vietnam! i think you'll need both the HA and vit C. HA provides hydration so you skin will just be generally plumper and healthier, but it wont help with the scarring. i use The Ordinary's HA and i think its great. as for vit C i think if your skin is still red and patchy maybe hold on a bit until things calm down as vit C can irritate your skin further,1,1,0
Both,1,1,0
It is your body and you should always feel empowered to make the decisions that are right for you. Doctors should just be advisors who can explain the risks and benefits of different courses of action to you. 

I am so sorry you felt pressured and would definitely recommend talking to a different primary care doctor or dermatologist who you feel like values your input, and then working with them to help find the best solutions for your skin.,8,8,0
Good for you! I‚Äôm in a somewhat similar boat although It doesn‚Äôt sound like my acne is quite as bad. But my derm is an accutane pusher even though I continually mention my hesitancy for mental health reasons. ,2,2,0
I did the same thing. I had severe acne last year (21 years old) and I was almost forced to take it

I passed on it and stuck to topical medicine. Best choice ever. My acne is much much better and under maintenance with the proper medication

Don't ever feel like you're forced to go one way. A good dermatologist would give you other options if you're not comfortable. I personally didn't want to do any oral medication, as I was scared for the repercussions that may come in the future ,2,2,0
HELL YES. Accutane can be so bad for your DNA and I'm in the same place you are. I've made up my mind that I'll never put that in my body no matter what my skin looks like. ,2,2,0
Let me preface this by saying that your story breaks my heart. You are not doomed to having acne forever, the fact that your mother had it just means that for both of you acne is triggered in a similar way. I.e. through dairy/gluten:refined sugar/undiscovered allergy etc. I believe you are on the right track cutting out dairy from your diet. Dairy and sugar break me out as well and as long as I stay away from them my acne stays in check. I would also recommend not using cleanser on your face because they All destroy beneficial micro biome on your face. Try to rebuild the beneficial bacteria which will in turn keep your sebum and harmful bacteria in check. A good way to rebuild it is by using a cotton pad and an alcohol free toner to wipe your face off and following with a light natural moisturizer. If you want me to recommend specific products which I found to be free of harmful chemicals and hypoallergenic then let me know.

As for birth control, You do know that birth control can also affect your mood namely making you more emotional? And that birth control reduces mineral absorption in your body thereby making you more susceptible to deficiencies and such further exacerbating acne? And that birth control can permanently mess up your hormonal balance leading to issues associated with that including infertility?  Not to mention the potential side effects from other medicines you‚Äôre taking. In comparison Accutane really doesn‚Äôt sound all that bad especially considering that most people don‚Äôt experience drastic side effects. That said, as I mentioned before, if you were to strictly change your diet and routine you may just cure most of your acne.
,1,1,0
My opinion would be to try it at a low dose. 

I was told for 7 years I can't take the drug because I have Ulcerative Colitis (some studies/claims are that Accutane can cause UC, so by already having UC and taking Accutane, it's a death sentence). 

I eventually got onto the drug with the support of my dermatologist and Gastroenterologist (took 7 years of convincing, and what sealed the deal was another person in the exact same position as me who was a 'guinea pig' and suffered no negative consequences). 

If anything, my UC was improved while I was on Accutane. Mood was better on Accutane. And by the end of it, my skin was better as well. 

Our situations are not the same, but I honestly feel that cystic acne does more harm to your mental well-being than what Accutane might cause. 

,1,1,0
Yo, seriously check out the gut-skin connection, might be the info you're looking for. I used to be in the same exact boat; I had pretty horrible cystic acne. A lot of my acne issues stemmed from bad digestion, which I soon realized was the culprit to my acne, along with a whole bunch of other things (anxiety, depression, a whole slew of mental disorders). This was all caused by a combo of bad diet, as well as anti-biotics (which birth control would fall under).


It sounds crazy, but try healing inside before EVER even considering Accutane. It will only cover up the problem, just like everything the dermatologists prescribe. I've changed my diet and exercise daily, along with meditate, and my skin is pretty good. It took a while, but finally fine with my skin. Don't hesitate to ask me anything about it.

Been on nuva ring for two months. No increases in acne. I was on the pill before and just could not control my acne even with the one that's suppose to help with acne. I also have been using differin for a month now and that could also be the reason my acne is more under control ,1,1,0

I got a little acne when I went off nuvaring some years ago. It settled down with differin and aczone.

Hello :) I am not sure if they are indented, but whether they are or not, the color will definitely fade. The pink/purple/red marks left over from wounds are known as post inflammatory erythmea, and can take anywhere from 3 months to a year to heal, sometimes longer. The longer they take the heal, the better healer you are (ironically.) ,1,1,0
PIE is the result of overactive blood vessels at the site of prior inflammation. They were multiplied in that area to provide essential nutrients for healing the initial wound. Because they continue to stay there, your body is still healing that particular wound- your healing reaction is strong. ,1,1,0

What else have you tried ? Are you concerned with the neurological side effects ?,1,1,0
Great questions - unfortunately science doesn't have the full answers. Let me try to address each part of your question. 

Rubbing dirt - while getting your face dirty with things that inflame it or are comedogenic can probably worsen acne, it doesn't seem to be a main cause in most people. [Acne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne) is more caused by internal inflammation related to hormonally related increased skin cell shedding, and oil and sebum production which also causes or is caused by a different natural fungal/bacterial growth pattern. 

Food - exact food linkages aren't super well established. Old theories like chocolate seem to not be particularly linked to acne. The best evidence I have seen is for long term consumption of high carbohydrate diets (e.g. juices, sodas, pasta, etc) as causes or things that will worsen it. 

Some foods may directly cause some inflammation which could also cause new acne blemishes or possibly worsen the appearance or grow existing blemishes. 

I would recommend meeting with a doctor in person who can review your diet and skin with you and help give you some good options to manage and prevent your acne.,2,2,0
Accutane is an intense drug. If it were me, that would be my last resort. In my opinion, it can't hurt to start the differin now. If it works and in a few months you don't have to start Accutane, I say that's a win. I am not an expert, and there are people on this sub with WAAAY more knowledge than me. So this is just my opinion. ,3,3,0
Might as well use differen while you‚Äôre waiting?  Idk accutane ain‚Äôt no joke. I‚Äôve been on differin for 8 weeks. Results can happen anytwhere from 6-12 weeks. I would try all possible routes. You never know - differin could be just what your skin needs ,4,4,0

FORGOT TO MENTION THIS IS 4 DAYS ON 20MG ACCUTANE DAILY

My acne has never been that bad, I have been using Retin A since December 2015 until my acne came creeping back worse than ever this April, I thought nothing of it so I kept using the Retin A until September, some pimples left marks which they never did even on Retin A so I have no idea what happened to my skin, it was always fine even without moisturizing or using sunscreen.

This is my face suddenly 4 days into 20mg of accutane a day, my derm recommended it because my acne is very persistent. 

Is this normal? I feel like a circus freak and I dont think I can do this if this stays. All those dots you see on my face? Most of them are flat and I dont feel anything, yet I don't remember getting acne there and them leaving marks. ,1,1,0
So I just starte using tazorac over the weekend. I've only used it twice. Does a purge start happening that quickly? I woke up this morning with two-three new whiteheads, and I didn't even use taz last night (I've been using every other night). I've been moisturizing, and don't use any other actives to avoid irrigation. I only use a pea size amount.
I have just started getting back into using my cerave foaming cleanser and cerave pm after a bad reaction from aczone (so I stopped everything and used a steroid cream until it calmed down). For the first few days before starting tazorac, I noticed I was always waking up with whiteheads around my mouth, but I have used cerave foaming and cerave pm for years without major issues.,3,3,0
I've used dozens of face cleansers, still get white heads when I wake up with changing my pillow case every other night. I just don't recommend popping whiteheads around your mouth / cheek area because the white heads seem to brush off or fall off when I'm in the shower or sometimes sleeping then drain internally ,2,2,0

Soak a towel under warm water. Apply warm wet towel to cyst. This will soften it up and hopefully make it poppable but be careful.,2,2,0
When I have a stubborn cystic acne, I get some OTC benzoyl peroxide, put a dab on the cyst(no need to smear it, you want to see it white), then cover it with a band-aid.  Every six hours or so I reapply more BP.  I'll keep reapplying for at least one more day after the swelling has gone down. ,1,1,0
Accutane doesn't work for everybody- I started getting acne again about a year after. But if I were you I would finish your course and not stress too much, you never know how things are going to be afterwards. If your acne is still significant you could definitely try things like eliminating dairy and see if that helps, no harm in that. And worse case you can always go back on accutane at some point. ,1,1,0
[deleted],3,3,0
For me, BP tends to pull things out of my skin. So I might not even know I have a bump below my skin but BP will pull it to the surface, often already at a head (so it's on its way to healing, anyway)! I think you just need to stick it out and stay consistent. It *could* be a slight purge but don't count on me with that claim LOL. BP is especially drying to your skin so make sure it's moisturized and taken care of, as dryness can sometimes cause some people to breakout. I hope this helps!,2,2,0

My dermalologist told me those who go an accutane that young usually have to do it twice just because of how much your body changes in those 5 years. I have never been on accutane, but thought that might be helpful. ,3,3,0
I started at about the same age, it came back ended up doing it 3 times. now 23 and still have acne, not as bad as back then but still about as bad as the acerage teenager except im an adult (technically)
,3,3,0
It is not ideal to go on accutane at that age, however if it was prescribed to you then it was probably the best option for your situation. Accuutane could be taken again but always do some blood tests, and more specifically liver enzymes, before strating again as that is where the drug gets absorbed.,1,1,0
What's your current regimen? ,1,1,0
Apple Cider Vinegar is my HG for acne. I used to break out really bad on my chin due to hormones and if I ate anything with unnatural sugars. I tried many different cleansers, exfoliators and natural remedies but using ACV cleared up most of my acne within the week. I use it every other night now and my face stays mostly clear. I notice that If I stop using it for an extended period a blemish will pop up, but not nearly as bad as it was before. It does sting a bit so dilute it with water 1:1 if you can't handle it, until your skin adjusts.

ACV is also good for facial discoloration, sunspots and fine lines- which is also a nice bonus :) 
Make sure the ACV is organic and has the 'mother' in it for best results!

You and your doctor should work together to determine if a vitamin/mineral supplement is right for you.,1,1,0
I'm going to be honest and say that there really is no natural supplement that can be used as a therapeutic for acne. Its good to discuss this with a doctor or a pharmacist however. If you believe there is a supplement you want to try, they have the resources to recommend a proper dosage that is safe for you. 

If you want to get rid of your acne however you really have 3 main options: hormone therapies, topical therapies or oral antibiotic/isotretinoin therapies. All of them are effective in their own ways, with a doctor you can figure out which is the best for you.,1,1,0
After taking anti-biotics it is helpful for you to replenish the good bacteria in your gut with probiotics as anti-biotics often kills off all bacteria, including the good bacteria, which can cause a variety of skin issues such as acne or rosacea. 

After doing a round of anti-biotics, I was suggested to take a probiotic 'therapy' does of 100billion once daily. I did that until the bottle was finished- roughly 60 days. Since then I take a 60billion dose daily which has really been great for my skin. I have mild rosacea and it really helps calm it.

As for other vitamins, I would suggest speaking with your DR and doing a blood test to see what you may be deficient in, as someone else recommended. Although, a multi-vitamin is a good place to start. Also taking a tsp of apple cider vinegar in water and chlorophyll in water separately is excellent for your body and skin also! 

Good luck :) ,1,1,0

Don't pick your acne. See a dermatologist. These two things should help immensely ,5,5,0
You've ruined your skin barrier washing it multiple times. Foaming agents will screw the ph and you're stripping the oils forcing your skin to produce more sebum. You need to no matter your skin type:
1) Invest in a cleanser with low ph without sls.
2) Wash only twice a day, morning and night.
3) Supplement yourself with vit b, zinc, probiotics, fish oils and vit d.
4) Ensure you use a humectant like hyaluronic acid to keep your skin hydration levels high. This helps your skin to heal faster when it's comfortable and you're likely to produce less oil.
5) Use a serum with niacinamide and zinc to control your sebum production, The Ordinary has a good one.
6) Moisturise with a suitable moisturiser. La Roche Posay is inexpensive and great for irritated skin like yours.
7) Sunscreen is an absolute must. It increases sebum production and you're likely to grown more acne. Also, it doesn't help with the scarring and pigmentation.
8) Never pick, never squeeze, leave your skin alone!

Stick this this routine, be as gentle as possible and let your skin heal itself. Once your skin barrier is functional, you'll notice less redness, less acne. At this point, introduce salicylic acid to exfoliate and BP to spot treat.

It's a marathon, not a race and you need to give your skin love in times like these, it's wrecked with all that scrubbing. See a derm later once it's ll calmed down, or your acne is persistent despite you've been 100%. Also make sure you eat more veg, less refined carbs and dairy. Good luck! ,4,4,0
Nooo don‚Äôt scrub it too often! And please get help from the doctor. ,3,3,0
Change cleanser, look foe something labeled "gentle" or "sensitive".. it won't bubble up, which means it won't strip oils, keep in the shower. Use an "exfoliating" cleanser once a week to satisfy that squeaky clean feeling.,3,3,0
Your acne is not because you are washing you skin too much. I assume you are washing your skin so often because you want to get rid of your acne. Unfortunately what is happening is you are stripping your skin of a necessary oil layer which can effectively dry your skin out and propagate your acne.

It looks to me like you have hormonal acne which is usually only solved with hormonal methods or accutane. I can also see you have some scarring occurring, I would recommend you visit a doctor and get set up with a good regimen.

Do you use any topical products like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid?,2,2,0
What your skin type? Dry? Oily ? Normal ? You have to know your skin before you start applying any product.,1,1,0
My skin was doing this for 2 years. I tried EVERYTHING including all of the advice on this page. I finally went and saw a dermatologist who did an extraction and prescribed clindamycin and tretanoin. It‚Äôs only been a week and I already see a difference. I recommend just seeing a dermatologist.,1,1,0
Antibiotics really wipe me out even when taking them for a short period of time. Are you taking any probiotics? Eating yogurt? It‚Äôs important to supplement your good gut bacteria because it might be getting decimated by your antibiotics :/ That can cause all sort of problems, from brain fog to c. difficile ,1,1,0

Switch to a non dairy milk and plant based sugar like stevia or no sugar at all.,5,5,0
Suagry raises your blood glucose level which increases your insulin level, which then bring s glucose down lower than than before you started (hypoglycemia). Then to compensate your liver releases triglycerides which activates the enzyme TOR, which increases sebum production and other hormones.

Suagry also binds with protein molecules in the body in a process called glycation. This completely destroys your collagen and elastic production and impairs your skins barrier. Making it less effective at dealing with future breakouts 

Short version: YES,1,1,0
There is evidence to suggest that a low glycemic diet can improve skin, but if you have severe acne the diet change can be negligible. Improving your diet is always a good thing but don't think that theres something wrong with you if your skin isn't responding to dietary changes. Acne can be caused by many factors.,1,1,0
I also recovered from an ED and my acne came back after I got my period back but I had also had acne for quite a bit before the onset of my restriction. So my experience is a little bit different. My best guess is that you probably experienced that breakout because your hormones were normalizing. I'm so glad it seems to be a one time thing though and you look stunning, good luck! ,3,3,0
Yeah, definetely hormonal related acne. Be grateful that you don't have to look like this for years with no end, like other acne sufferers. But even that wouldn't ruin your beautiful face. ,1,1,0

Bad news: it's going to take time
good news: it's possible. 
Serious option-Retin A 0.025% a couple times a week. Your skin will peel & you'll have to use a good sunscreen everyday. 
easier options- use a BHA/AHA serum nightly. I really like the Peter Thomas Roth ($50) clear one for acne  
Amazon has a vitamin C & Retin A serum that has amazing reviews & that would greatly help and is priced far less than the serum above
-I recently purchased a handheld FDA approved UV red light "true glow by Conair" that is supposed to stimulate collagen production($30)so new skin forms faster but have not used it diligently enough
-controversial option from Amazon that also requires long term effort: Admire my skin 2% hydroquinone fade cream($24). Some people are allergic to hydroquinone & It may lighten skin too much from what I read.

That's inflamed acne. You can try a variety of things. Usually first thing is over the counter stuff like benzoyl peroxide and etc. Next are usually topical medications like antibiotics and retinoids prescribed by your doctor or even accutane.

Depending on your age, you might want to wait until your hormones stabilize, or start with some treatment to prevent scarring and emotional distress.

I know you probably don't want to hear this but... esthetician. There's no way to properly pop your own pimples, especially if you don't have the training. Go to a professional!,4,4,0
i honestly wouldn‚Äôt. i‚Äôm a hypocrite because i try to pop my pimples the ‚Äúright way‚Äù but always end up like ‚Äúwow why did i not just leave it alone?‚Äù. id say just continue your normal routine & use a spot treatment if you don‚Äôt already. icing the skin can also help with the redness/swelling (& it feels so good),3,3,0
Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way to pop a pimple. I am fully and personally aware that it‚Äôs much easier said than done as far as not messing with them, but after way too long it finally got through my head how much better my face looked when I DIDN‚ÄôT try to pop/mess with an acne lesion. I now just put some appropriate topical on the pimple overnight/during the day and, on the next couple days, depending on how much the acne has gone down or the inflammation has lessened, I just put a bit of concealing makeup over the offending area and wait for the zits to start to go away on their own (they don‚Äôt really leave bad marks for me they way). My acne is fairly mild, so that works for me, but whenever I had tried to pop a pimple or several, it suddenly looks like I had a horrible case of acne all over my face because I‚Äôve aggravated every simple, mild lesion. So basically I can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt answer your question because it‚Äôs a bit of a trap, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. Even if there were a right way to pop a zit, it would definitely still leave a mark. If you don‚Äôt pop it, yeah, maybe people will be able to see that you have acne, even with makeup, but one can learn how to disguise that fairly well and look okay.,1,1,0

Can you give some more information on your age and gender? It looks to me like hormonal acne given the oil on your skin and closed comedones. ,1,1,0
Sounds like your hygeine isn't the problem. But have you tried something that is more geared to acne? Glycolic acid, sacyilic acid and benzoyl peroxide are all worth trying however for some people it just irritates the skin more and causes worse acne (like me). 
Have you tried diet changes, cutting out certain foods or adding supplements? Dairy and oddly enough oranges are always big culprits for me. Adding more water too, more than what you think is necessary is always helpful and exercise to get blood flowing to the skin and help to regulate stress hormones too. 
Lastly do you have bowel problems? That can also be linked to acne so sometimes it's about healing the gut and decreasing inflammation to clear the skin up. ,4,4,0
If acne products aren't working, it could be fungal.

Oh honey I'm so sorry to hear that. I've struggled with acne my whole life. Kids are mean. Most of them are extremely self conscious about something about themselves as well. They point out things that will make you feel bad so they don't have to feel as bad about themselves. The truth is, we all struggle with our looks. Try your very hardest not to pick even if it means wearing gloves when you get anxious. You can turn this into a lifetime issue if you continue to pick. Get yourself some over the counter differin and use routinely for two months. I'm in the process myself at 24 years old.  It's working great. I hope that you can turn to a school counselor or a teacher for support emotionally. You don't have to suffer alone. Those kids usually end up very troubled in life, look beyond them and find something you enjoy and do that every time you feel bad about it. Channel that energy into something good. ,6,6,0
Hey listen kids are shit, they don't know how to deal with their insecurities yet so they try and shove it onto others. That's so ugly that's 10x uglier than the worst acne ever. Do you know what scares them though? Confidence, it honestly is. You could be classified as the ugliest person ever but if you walk in a room with confidence those kids will cower in a corner. You become invincible to them, so they will give up and it will deeply embarrass them, purely their own fault. 

Take everything they say and let it bounce off you because it's meaningless it's just what they can't cope with themselves. Laugh at it, notice how pathetic it is. Look at them weirdly because they don't understand what having a skin condition is like. They're ignorant. Maybe that will change maybe it won't that's not your problem. You already know more than that in this field, that means you are now more able to empathise with others on issues like this. That's priceless, they haven't got that yet so let that boost your confidence because a lot of people go through their whole lives without understanding empathy. 

Acne is so annoying, I get you I've had it for 7 years and I've had my downs like suicidal downs. There's no cure because acne is a side effect of something else. Go get your blood tested. It could be your liver, your thyroid overproducing or under, it could be your digestion. Knowledge is power don't succumb to a side effect. It's like having a headache everyday you need to understand what's causing it. 

There are lots of conflicted studies on diet and acne. I think it's completely down to the individual if it does make a difference of not. I noticed wheat makes mine worse so now I don't eat it. Diary has a bunch of hormones in which also makes mine worse. Maybe keep a diary of what you're eating and the flare ups you have acne wise. Your acne may be because your family have had it but that doesn't mean there's not a reason. You may all be sensitive to a certain type of food. That's just an example but don't give up. It's so hard and relentless at times but remember it's something inside that's gone wrong so find out. And lastly it may just be teenage acne, purely because your hormones are going crazy, it's natural it's normal. Some people don't get acne but they could get something else like suddenly they sweat more than normal or their hair starts to thin. People aren't perfect. Acne is easier to see yes but that doesn't mean people without it are perfect. Look at yourself and notice you're not your skin and anyone that treats you like that are so boring and superficial, don't waste your time, empathy, compassion on them it's simply not worth it. Do shit that makes you happy and fuck everyone else who upsets you over this. Be invincible, just be you. ,5,5,0
 I feel ya. I‚Äôm almost 27 years old  & I suffer from cystic / hormonal acne ( maybe ) I‚Äôve never been to a dermatologist before , but I have started differin and birth control  in hopes that it clears it up. I‚Äôve been on differin for 7 weeks , and I don‚Äôt notice much difference to be honest with you. 

Sometimes I think I was cursed with acne , like I must be doing the wrong thing To deserve to feel this way. I understand how you feel. I can‚Äôt imagine being a teenage girl in this day and age.. if there‚Äôs one thing I can tell you from experience though - they don‚Äôt matter. Their comments , their views about you , etc is all temporary. All that truly matters is how you view yourself... I know if sounds soooo cliche , but it‚Äôs true. 

I find I have to remind myself quite often  that what truly matters isn‚Äôt our ‚Äú shells ‚Äú it‚Äôs our souls. People that love you don‚Äôt care what your face looks like. They will love you just as much with or without acne. 

Hang in there , girl. ‚ô•Ô∏è,4,4,0
Fuck those kids. Literally just tell yourself fuck them, you deserve respect and confidence, having acne doesn't make you less human. Don't ask for respect, demand it, like there's no other option. Honestly they are so insecure. Once they leave school they will literally be so lost because they feel like they have something right now because they have social status in school and that is their whole life. Once they leave and their status fades they will go through a period of crisis because suddenly in the big wide world no one worships them anymore! Just forget about them and stay positive, enjoy doing the things you like doing regardless of everyone else.,3,3,0
Those kids are assholes and I'm so sorry you have to deal with them. I am an adult and get acne and definitely feel you - I hate it SO much, but at least I don't have little bastards taunting me for it, it's just self inflicted loathing (and even I know it's not THAT bad, I just wish I had clear glowing skin). I'm a nervous picker too, so I think we should both look into ways we can stop doing this. I'll let you know if I come up with something! I'm sure there's some sort of distraction thing we can do. ,2,2,0

Cetaphil moisturizing cream always felt too heavy for me, maybe you should try a gel based moisturizer.,4,4,0
How often are you washing your face ? The more you wash the more oil your skin will produce to over compensate.  I try to only wash once in the morning and once again at night unless I have to re do my face make up say for an evening out. 

I use CeraVe gentle foaming cleanser and the lotion and I've had great luck with both. Really helps to calm and neutralize the skin and doesn't leave me too dry or greasy.,5,5,0
It might sound counter intuitive, but try using an oil such as rosehip or jojoba in place or your moisturizer. For some people, after you put it on your skin is just like ‚Äúoh there‚Äôs already oil here, no need to make more‚Äù so it helps with that. If you wanna research them, know that there are 2 types: oleic and linoleic. If you have acne or are acne prone, pick an oil thats high in linoleic content (like rosehip). If your skin can get dehydrated or you just want more moisture, pick one high in oleic content (like almond or avocado oil or something) If you want one that‚Äôs super close to your skins natural oil, which is most likely to ‚Äútrick‚Äù your skin‚Äôs oil production system, i recommend jojoba oil. a lot of people rave about oils but remember that your mileage may vary. Sometimes they might just make you break out. Also, get one that clearly states it‚Äôs 100% that oil. A lot of cheap ones say they‚Äôre jojoba oil, for example, but are actually mostly soybean oil, which is much cheaper to buy but less effective. Good luck!,2,2,0
Press on it. If it doesn't disappear, it's PIH.

This might be a dimb question, but do you bring a towel or washcloth with you to sipe sweat off at the gym? Maybe its worth a shot doing the opposite for a week and seeing if you notice any changes. 

Also, maybe its a combo of other things and the gym? Stress and cortisol increase and all of that type of thing. ,1,1,0
I bring Murad wipes to the gym with me so I can quickly give my face a cursory cleanse right away, before I even go home. I think it has helped a bit for me. ,1,1,0
I also have oily skin with acne and I can't use any products with oil without breaking out severely unfortunately.  I use Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water gel. It doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky and it's the only thing that doesn't break me out or clog up my pores. It's not a heavy moisturizer, but it does an effective job at keeping my skin nice and soft.

My esthetician told me that if your skin is really oily then you don‚Äôt need to apply a moisturizer. This seems to make sense to me. If you start treating your skin with drying agents, then at that point you can add a light moisturizer.,1,1,0
Use Clinique cleanser (pink),Paula's choice resist weightless toner with Shiseido cotton, sebamed clear face gel for moisturizer & Clinique 50 spf mineral sunscreen and grape seed oil occasionally at night & nexcare acne patches. Only use benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid as a spot treatment no more than twice a week. And after your skin calms down do manual exfoliation with a brush no harsh scrubs (MUST wash tone moisturizer twice a day and protect in morning with spf)

Of course eat healthy see if there are any triggering foods in your diet. Keep hormones balanced Keep stress level low and get a good amount of sleep. Enjoy your life do something you love. Use paper towels to dry your face after washing. Change pillow case every two days and wash bed sheets and covers once a week. Keep hair and hair products away from your face and check if detergent you wash clothes with can be irritating you.

This may sound like an odd suggestion, but I had a similar issue where acne products just would not work on the acne, and what ended up helping was putting yogurt on my face.

It turns out my condition was fungal. There was an unhealthy balance in the microbes on my skin so that's why the acne products didn't work.

If you want to test if it's fungal before paying to go to a doctor, put full fat, no sugar added yogurt on your face overnight (it hardens in 10 min) and see if your acne looks calmer in the morning. I promise you won't smell like sour milk!!,13,13,0
I definitely have. It is an internal issue. For me, I have a lot of allergies and I realized that my digestions problems have caused my acne. I've taken many steps to heal these issues, and now I'm almost acne free. Do the same and fix the problem instead of masking the symptoms, which is acne. ,3,3,0
I was at my wits end and wanted to do one last thing before succumbing to accutane and started seeing an esthetician. I have been to 3 dermatologists and have gotten injections, put on birth control, put on antibiotics, and have used every over the counter product I could get my hands on. I now go every 6-7 weeks and get extraction facials. The esthetician spends more time with me than the dermatologist and did not push products or medicine in my face. Instead, they examined my skin and made recommendations tailored to me, they actually LISTENED to me. 

They recommended an all natural cleanser (I use hyalunia facial cleansing gel), using benzoyl peroxide at night and gave me moisturizing tips and ingredients to avoid based on the appearance of my skin over multiple visits. They also recommended using a sunscreen powder that is made up of zinc alone, which has helped by protecting my already existing scars and not letting them get any darker via sun exposure. I wish I could go tell you to use specific products but I know everyone's skin is different, hence why I cannot recommend finding a good esthetician enough.

My recommendation would be switching to a plain, gentle, cleanser and moisturizer. I use cetaphil for both and that works well for me. My skin always breaks out when I switch products, so I would find something that works for you and stick with that. I personally use BP as a spot treatment and retin a at night before moisturizer. I also take zinc and vitamin e and that seems to help with my acne. ,3,3,0
You gotta save some money, I know it isn't easy, but seriously try. Then go to an MD or ND, ask for these RX: spironolactone, doxycycline, topical clyndamycin, and topical tretinoin. Get some RX savings cards, like a few, they are free(just google it). Tell the pharmacy to use the one that offers the best discount for each RX. These goodrx discount cards save me so much money! Walmart is most often the cheapest place to fill. Anyway, once you've got these RX, practice using them consistently. Like a daily ritual. Also, very important- stop eating dairy and limit sugar to no more than about 9 grams per meal. Quitting sugar is like the hardest part of all this. 
I am telling you, believe me, my skin looked exactly like yours for years! I finally found this routine that works like a total cure. 
It's expensive. I know. I don't have insurance either. And make no mistake, it takes a Herculean amount of effort and discipline. Don't take it lightly or you'll be setting yourself up for failure. Dedicate yourself and you will be so happy with the results! Doing all this cured my acne.  It changed my life. Good luck!!,3,3,0
You need salicylic acid, aha or peroxide acne cream. Google products on this sub. ,3,3,0
So if I were you I'd ignore any of the dietary advice going around here. There really is no scientific link to suggest that diet and acne are related (some evidence to support dairy but I'd regard that as loose evidence).

What you have in my opinion is hormonal acne. The options you have are controlling your hormones through medications or accutane. I haven't found topical medications to be of much use for my hormonal acne myself and I would think you would experience the same.

Unfortunately if you do not have insurance, this is an expensive problem to fix. I would recommend looking into financing a treatment if it is very important to you or waiting until it is affordable through insurance or when financial opportunity arises.,3,3,0
I'd consider accutane. It was the only thing that worked for me. ,2,2,0

Get some RX savings cards, like a few, they are free(just google it). Tell the pharmacy to use the one that offers the best discount for each RX. These goodrx discount cards save me so much money! Walmart is most often the cheapest place to fill. Anyway, once you've got these RX, practice using them consistently. Like a daily ritual. Also, very important- stop eating dairy and limit sugar to no more than about 9 grams per meal. Quitting sugar is like the hardest part of all this. 
I am telling you, believe me, my skin looked exactly like yours for years! I finally found this routine that works like a total cure. 
It's expensive. I know. I don't have insurance either. And make no mistake, it takes a Herculean amount of effort and discipline. Don't take it lightly or you'll be setting yourself up for failure. Dedicate yourself and you will be so happy with the results! Doing all this cured my acne.  It changed my life. Good luck!!,2,2,0

Hey everyone!! Here's an update ( [12 days later](https://m.imgur.com/a/BYTG1) ). My friend got me benzoyl peroxide 5% wash, clindamycin wipes and tretinoin gel to apply daily. Hoping to see more improvement. I appreciate all the advice :),1,1,0
Have you been to a gynecologist before?,1,1,0
go to a GP/derm and ask for antibiotics or oral drugs to deal with it, it helps a lot ,0,0,0
It should probably best be applied at night before bed, one very thin layer, maybe test it out first on a patch of skin just in case of reaction. Start off maybe every other day for a week or so then up in gradually to everyday. Recommended pea size amount. Moisturize in the morning or when dry, but I wouldn't moisturize that much. It's different for everyone but many people do go through the purge. You should be able to see a difference in maybe 3 months or so.,1,1,0

I've not had acne in a while... still like this. 

I have such a complex skin routine now, honestly never spent so much time on it! But it's worth it, just wish I wasn't so obsessed.,1,1,0
I've never quite understood this pattern either. My skin looks way better upon first waking, and then gets angrier as the day goes on. Maybe it's just that laying horizontally somehow helps healing/bloodflow? No clue!,2,2,0
Its our immune system and how the inflammatory processes work, they slow down during the night and when we wake up, we see less inflammation. You aren't doing anything wrong :),1,1,0
It might be hormonal. You could try a sicilyic (spelling error) acid topical to spot treat/change your routine and if that doesn't work you could see a Derm and they would probably put you on birth control or something like spironlactone. But it looks very minor so try not to worry it too much, it's not very noticeable. ,1,1,0

It can take up to 3 months for your skin to clear on BPO. Give it time. Acne usually goes away sometime between your late teens and early 20s, but a minority of people will go on to have "adult acne" that persists. There is no way of knowing when yours will.,2,2,0
Your skin is irritated from the prescriptions.
My skin would peel endless, almost in sheets when I used topical clindamycin.
My suggestion is to drinks LOTS of water, take flax oil, and apply heavy cream moisturizer to help combat the dryness and try to heal the skin barrier.,4,4,0

If you really believe your gf will break up with you because you have acne you should dump her now. But if she really likes you she won't give a fuck about your acne. What your are experiencing is called a break out. A sudden plethora of pimples appear and you get super stressed out. Don't worry. It is normal. It will pass. ,7,7,0
I definitely feel you on the self confidence issue. I didn't start getting acne until after I graduated from High School. And going into college as a freshman with a face full of acne drains a lot of your self confidence.

What I had to keep telling myself which helped me realize is that, 'people will see you for who you are.' And yes I do mean that in the clich√© sense, but also in the complete literal sense as well. If you are a great person on the inside and treat everyone equally and show love and support for the people you care about, people you don't know, and even people you just meet, then the people who actually truly care about you in return will see you for who you are as a human being, not as someone who has pimples.

There are people who are born with noticeable birth marks, with disabilities, or deformations, but everybody like this has the greatest personalities. Use this time to become someone who people love because of who you are and not what you look like. It can change the rest of your life for the better. Your girlfriend has started liking you because of your personality, don't doubt that, and don't overthink it. If she leaves because of pimples then it's her loss because you will keep becoming a better person from knowing who you are inside vs just whats on the outside.,7,7,0
Acne is just a temporary thing, it can't make you "look ugly", just like a hairstyle or smeared lipstick doesn't make someone ugly. 
I'm not in highschool anymore, but I dated guys with acne and never had a problem with it. If anything, I felt sympathy... thankfully (or not) all my breakouts happened in middle school. Maybe your girlfriend has had her own skin woes and can relate. I'm sure you are a very handsome young man, inside and out!,4,4,0

Your mileage may vary. I‚Äôve heard great things about it. I used it one time on my body and my shoulders, chest, upper arms, and back broke out in inflamed whiteheads, which is very rare for me.,3,3,0

Doxycycline, prescribed by my pcp, did not work very well for me and it gave me stomach issues. She referred me to a Derm who put me on Minocycline with Aczone in the am, Epiduo Forte in the pm and cetaphil washes and moisturizers, which all worked great. Buuuut, then my Derm office decided to no longer prescribe long term abx for acne üòï. So, then I tried Spiro, but almost immediately began to experience mood issues (which is uncommon, but not unheard of). So now I‚Äôm just doing the topical creams. It‚Äôs not great, but at least I don‚Äôt want to climb out of my skin.,1,1,0

Could they be Nodules?,1,1,0
So it's best to leave those alone. What's happening is you have a bunch of bacteria deep in your pore and an immune response occurring that creates a module filled with pus under your skin.

By popping this you are disturbing your skin by causing more inflammation, your body is already trying to keep it under control, let it. There isn't much you can do when those are formed but wait, or if they are really bad, get cortisone shots.

Preventing them is key, and by getting on a good acne regimen you can do that. I'd recommend talking with your doctor. There is a lot of misinformation on the sub and I find a lot of people are shamed by things like diet or hygiene when in reality, acne is not really caused by either. ,1,1,0

I realize you are asking about self treatment - but if you are recurrently getting cystic acne I would strongly recommend visiting a doctor. This is something that often oral antibiotics and topical or oral retinoids can really help. It also helps avoid the scarring that can sometimes come with cystic acne. ,4,4,0
Mines last atleast  two months then im dealing with the red marks for around 6 months after. I haven't found much to help them in terms of spot treatments. Was on antibiotics and they kept them away for 4 months but now i have become resistent, got an appt for derm on Monday thankfully!,2,2,0

For future reference, contact your pharmacist and see if they are OK with you tapering your doses.

I think that way does work for a while, but you still need some kind of soap to get rid of all the bacteria and dead skin cells on your face. That's pretty similar to what I did. I also ate vitamin supplements (omega 3 and multivitamins) for a while and it really helped.,3,3,0
Use pure aloe Vera to wash your face! Big difference ,1,1,0
Use Clinique cleanser (pink),Paula's choice resist weightless toner with Shiseido cotton, sebamed clear face gel for moisturizer & Clinique 50 spf mineral sunscreen and grape seed oil occasionally at night & nexcare acne patches. Only use benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid as a spot treatment no more than twice a week. And after your skin calms down do manual exfoliation with a brush no harsh scrubs (MUST wash tone moisturizer twice a day and protect in morning with spf)

Of course eat healthy see if there are any triggering foods in your diet. Keep hormones balanced Keep stress level low and get a good amount of sleep. Enjoy your life do something you love. Use paper towels to dry your face after washing. Change pillow case every two days and wash bed sheets and covers once a week. Keep hair and hair products away from your face and check if detergent you wash clothes with can be irritating you.

I would say start with hair product. Avoid sulfates in your shampoo and forego styling products for a bit and see if it calms down.

I think I have this, too. My ex-derm prescribed me a special shampoo (probably what the others are naming here) but it came back even though I finished all of it.

What helped was switching from a polyester pillowcase to a 100% cotton pillowcase. Wash it with a hypoallergenic detergent and try eating healthy.,1,1,0
That happened to me as well during my first 6 weeks. Don‚Äôt apply it so much around your eyelids and the corners of your mouth, lips, and nose.

The minimalist approach does not work for me either, when I tried it long ago. I tried everything from antibiotics to creams and different soaps. I can say please try the basis soap you won't be disappointed,0,0,0
Stop using everything! Your face and body should fight the acne itself. You're creating more breakouts by adding all this stuff to your face and on top of that it's not good for your skin. Stop using everything and go out to Walmart and buy "Basis" soap. Wash your face twice a day, three times if needed. No moisturizer or lotion needed, just soap.,-3,-3,0

I have experiences this on and off for just over a year now, but is now recurring about every week. 22yo,  struggled with a bit of acne as a teen and still. This flares up at non-hormonal times and is extremely swollen, shiny, very painful, hot and red. Massive effect on self esteem and impossible to completely cover with makeup. I have been to a dermatologist for my acne only who only suggested accutane (I struggle with depression so rejected it). Currently treating with diluted tea tree oil and cetaphil moisturiser. My doctor has said nothing but keep up my skincare regime.

What could this possibly be (some kind of infection, it's constantly recurring?) it's really upsetting me. Thank you ,3,3,0
This isn‚Äôt treatment advice, but it might help you day to day. Dermacol foundation is pretty much the most high coverage one out there, so I think you should try using it. I‚Äôm almost certain it would cover the redness, since I‚Äôve seen YouTube videos where they even cover super dark tattoos. It was originally for Hollywood movies and photography though, so its wear time isn‚Äôt the best. It‚Äôs not bad nonetheless from what I hear though, you just might wanna mix it in with another foundation. Good luck with everything!,2,2,0

It's maybe rosacea, try a mix of betamethason and tyrothricin.,1,1,0
I used to get these all the time in highschool my gosh!!!! And only on my nose. Eventually they just stopped but they are extremely painful. 
The only thing that really helped me was coconut oil and tumeric (paste) and I would rub this AROUND the pimple, for the swelling and pain and then would put tea tree oil directly ON the pimple. 

Disclaimer: I am only recommending this if you are not sensitive to oils/ coconut oil. I know coconut oil can break people out but if your skin can deal with oils, coconut oil and tumeric is like the ultimate anti-inflammatory/anti-bacterial duo and coconut oil [is the single best source of Lauric acid there is.](https://draxe.com/lauric-acid/) I'm currently on accutane and I'm in the initial breakout stage so I get cysts all the time and I can't put any topicals on them, so I literally just slather tumeric and coconut oil all over them before bed.

Hi,
I couldn't not leave a comment.
I had exact same situation years ago. Appeared when I was 15 or close, exact identical everything. Enormous effect on self esteem as well, and my parents didn't give a shit, so I had to be present in front of peers, no makeup no nothing, was hiding in a school toilet... After maybe 2 years it started to appear much less often, maybe like every 2-2.5 month and then this red nose issue dissapeared on its own. But general condition of the skin remained to be awful. When I was 23-24yo I was first introduced to Doxy and that was the only thing that really helped ever after all topic shit and everything. After 4 years being on Doxy (on for 2 months and then a break for 3-4 months) I got tired and surrendered to Accutane. Now I shit you not - Accutane is the best invention humanity ever made. Dude, my condition was probably the worst in the world, but it f-king helped, I mean it.  I would have committed a serious crime if somebody promised me a quick solution (like accutane in my case) back when I was 14-15...,1,1,0

I would run to the closest store/pharmacy and get hydrocolloid bandages. [Lance the pimple properly](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj64drRwL_WAhXGJiYKHUhfCU0QtwIIKDAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oprah.com%2Fown-oprahshow%2Fdr-oz-demonstrates-how-to-properly-pop-a-pimple-video&usg=AFQjCNGzwu7FT1t2K1QLAm-mwQKsDmp8kw) and stick the bandaid on. Leave it on while you sleep and if you're leaving the house, take if off if you want to. If not, just put another one on while you're lounging around the house. It will drain out the pus and flatten the pimple and reduce redness.,1,1,0
I notice you didn't say you've tried benzoyl peroxide or differin gel. These help alot of people (they've helped me a good bit as well) and I'd say it's at least worth a shot. Benzoyl peroxide dries out my face horribly so I can only use it on my forehead where I'm extremely greasy lol but seeing as you have oily skin, it might work okay for you. Also, you could try a AHA or BHA toner. I have one by cosrx that has both in it. I'm not sure how much this has helped (I think a majority of my progress has come from the benzoyl peroxide cleanser I use) but it definitely hasn't hurt me at all. Of course, everyone's acne solutions are different and I can only speak for myself, so this is absolutely not a guarantee that it'll work. Just something to keep in mind. Good luck!! ,1,1,0

Currently using of adepalene (.05) and clindamycin. 

I'm not sure what you're referring to by "purge" but when I first started using it, it made my skin look worse. I think this process brings up the deep pimples to the surface and dries them out. I use it once a day. After a couple days, the skin around my lips start to peel, so then I discontinue it until my lips are better. I have been using adepalene on and off for quite a few months now, maybe 6. 

It has been really effective at clearing my skin. My only complaint is that it makes my skin very dry, and even thought I don't apply it on my lips, it makes the skin on my lips peel. You win some you lose some I guess. ,2,2,0
My purge lasted around 5-6 weeks. I thought it would've helped with my pie but it doesn't seem to have :(,1,1,0
I started out at 0.1% (which you can now get over-the-counter in the United States). I didn't experience a purge that I can remember. I started every other night the first week, then increased to every night by the second week. My skin was showing some improvement about a month later when I followed up with my dermatologist, and she ended up bumping me up to 0.3% (still need a prescription for this). I would say I saw significant improvement on the 0.3% within a month or two, so by 3 months of starting, I was feeling pretty good about my skin. I was also prescribed topical clindamycin at the same time, though I doubt that played much of a role in helping clear my skin - it hasn't really in the past and I've since stopped using it.

Now, all that said, my skin stayed pretty good on the Differin for about 6-7 months, but unfortunately I started breaking out again after that. I went through a stressful time period and had traveled to a different climate and started taking a biotin supplement (which I've since read can contribute to breakouts), so all of that might have been too much for the Differin to keep the acne at bay.

Note that when you start, your skin might be pretty sensitive - I made the mistake of getting my eyebrows waxed early on before my skin had adjusted and it ripped some of my skin off.

Good luck!!

If you look up PIH and PIE you can work out what type of red mark it is.

It will go in time. Mine has gone down so much already. But expect this to take a good few months if the marks are quite dark. 

You need to use a BHA or AHA. Vitamin C cream may also help. My best AHA is the 30% from the Ordinary, a few times a month. I didn't use it more often.

I try not to use too many products and I'm always wary of them not being 'needed' but the AHA did help. 

Also, keep your face out the sun and use sun block.
Sun can worsen the red marks, although ironically can improve the appearance of them at first. I've also been told to avoid harsh physical exfoliation of these areas before, as that can also make the red marks worse.

I have spent a lot of money in sephora looking for a miracle serum to get rid of my dark spots for the last 3 years, something changed and left me with nasty dark spots.

What i do is wash my face with a gentle glycolic wash (I use the Made from Earth Grapefruit Glycolic Wash), and then dry my face. Afterwards, I use the Somaluxe Brightening Peptide Serum in areas where I have my dark spots.

I used to use the Somaluxe toner, but I do not anymore. I do the routine I mentioned above twice per day now for the last week and I it's doing something and I'm super excited to keep seeing results. It works !,1,1,0

cut dairy, processed foods and sugar. Only get your sugar from fruits. Also up your vegetable intake. Your skin will clear up immensely.,1,1,0
*My* doctor told me to not bother with the dairy cutting out as she said it was basically not likely to be causing my acne and that the link is tenuous with conflicting evidence.

I went dairy free for a year with no results. As fair as I can tell, cutting out dairy helps for some people but only a few.

There are loads of 'special diets' for acne and I tried them all. 

The only one I had some success with was a high fat diet, my skin felt amazing but it didn't very little for my actual acne.

I think the issue for me was that I got so caught up with the acne I was desperate to cure it.

This is just me though, you could be one of the people that does have issues with dairy. 

What have you tried in terms of medication? 

And in answer to your question- when people say cut out all dairy, they mean all. But cottage cheese and such will only be bad for your skin if your acne *is actually caused by dairy.*

It might not be. So give it a try and if it doesn't work then you'll know.

My experience with cutting out dairy was unhelpful, but there are people on this sub who it did help.,1,1,0
I'm also trying to do this, but damn I do love cheese. Gonna be bloody hard. Be careful of Googling as well... if you read a thread about how cutting dairy out didn't work, the replies agree. Yet if ya read a thread about how it did work... people agree! People are biased online in how they reply, and what threads they get attracted too.

Try it and if it works for you then cool. It might not but worth a try, anything to get rid of these suckers on my face.

Personally I think cottage cheese is disgusting but there are better sources of protein. My friend is a vegan body builder and he manages, although he does need to buck up his ideas and learn to kick as friggin LENTILS AND RICE is not a good lunch and dinner everyday of the year! 

If you're gonna do the dairy free bit try and make sure you know some good recipes. I guess having a restrictive diet is easier if you can cook.

Did absolutely nothing for me. 

I cut out dairy completely 5 years ago when I first went to the derm bc that's what she told me to do. However, it did nothing and my acne just seemed to be getting worse as I got older. Now I'm on accutane. 

I still don't drink milk or eat cheese but I do eat Greek yogurt (solely for the protein). 
Guess it's just up to you to try it. Some people swear by it but for most, it does nothing. ,1,1,0
Hold on, you do not need exogenous proteins from a cow to go to the gym. There are certain amino acids, growth hormones and compounds that restricts shown to initiate cancer.

It's best to avoid things like whey and casein. The best option would be to get your protein from whole plant sources that actually protect against cancer and have various other great benefits.

As for the dairy, if you have acne it is definitely a great first step to completely get rid of all dairy in your diet. This includes in your coffee, in ingredients in food etc. There are many other tasty amazing options out there for coffee and cereal like soy almond cocnit rice hemp and cashew.

You should start there, but there are many other things that can initiate acne. Things such as suagry and high glycemic foods (bread, pasta, white potatoes). Processed sugar. Too much omega 6 in relation to omega 3, too much meat and eggs as they are high in a certain protein that can initiate acne.

The best thing is to drink lots of water, eat tons of water rich green vegetables. Include turmeric in your daily diet for the antoinflammatory benefits. Eat lots of orange vegetables like carrots, sweet potato and squash. Avocados for their amazing fat soluble vitamins and antinflammatory benefits. High omega 3 rich raw nuts and seeds like flax chia hemp, and walnuts. Keep suagry and high glycemic foods low aim for a relatively high fat of around 30-50%. There's more that I'm probably forgetting but that should be a good start.,0,0,0
It's really hard to, but I completely understand how you feel. It's hard to forget, but I find that every single time I think of it I just make my mind think of something else, just move your train of thought away from acne super quick. Also don't spend too long looking in the mirror. Literally look and go, (even if it doesn't) "yeah my skin looks good" or compliment one of your other features. Spend like 3 seconds max looking in the mirror and just focus on other features than your acne. Stay strong man, other people out there feel your pain too, we struggle together. ,8,8,0
I've had acne my whole life, even as a baby my mom jokes about how I had "baby acne" lol.. but it is tough. I've been bullied all through elementary,  middle and high school. Been called all the names in the book (the one I still have nightmares about is pepperoni face). Anyways, I was once lost with what to do, and I too gave up. After a while of just dealing with the fact my face is a zitty mess and pretended I didn't notice people staring at it, my doctor suggested accutane. I was completely unaware about what it was and when I read about it online it scared the shit out of me cause of all the side effects (dry skin, dry lips, basically dry everything, muscle and joint pain, depression, and not to mention if you have a baby while on it the birth defects). But after some serious thought I decided to do it. I'm now on month 2 and although I'm breaking out like a bitch, my skin (not acne ) has gotten noticeably better. You're suppose to take it for about 6 months and your face is suppose to be clear for the rest of your life (depending how bad your acne is, you may have to do 2 courses) but in long run I think it's worth it! I'm not sure if you've considered accutane before or even know what it is (it didnt) but I highly suggest!!
BTW I've always had clinical depression, part of the reason is from being bullied about my acne. Even just 2 months on accutane I haven't found my depression to get worse and I have gotten more confident about myself knowing soon I won't have acne!! 
Hope this helps :) best of luck my friend.,7,7,0
Have you considered accutane? You should really look into it. I can relate to you and your post 110% and I feel for you. I had bad acne as well which started around the time I was about 20'ish. It made me soooo freakin self conscious and depressed, I was almost suicidal at times. I stopped leaving the house for months because of my face. I tried EVERYTHING to clear it up. Diet changes. Different Birth control pills. Antibiotics for many many months. Medicated prescription washes and creams. ProActive religiously for 6 months. Spent $9k on laser surgery for my acne (which was excruciating pain). And nothing really helped me. It all just made my face a dry peeling mess. God it was AWFUL. 

After a few years of failed treatments I finally caved and got a prescription for accutane. I read soooo much about it beforehand that scared me. But it honestly was a LIFESAVER for me. I wish I would have just taken it from the start. I had an amazing experience on accutane and I would recommend it to anybody. It WILL suck for a few months, but things WILL improve around 2.5-3 months. Your face will begin to clear and smoothen out and be less red and inflamed/irritated. My skin is pretty much great for the most part now. I am 28 now and people never believe me when I tell them I had horrible acne for years. My skin is clear and smooth with no obvious scarring. If I do breakout now, they are small and go away quickly. Not those huge deep mean bumps that lasted for weeks like before I took accutane. 

Accutane was really the only thing that worked for me and I spent years and thousands of dollars on treatments. My acne was genetic, so it was honestly unavoidable. All my brothers had acne as well and my fathers side of the family has awful acne. It used to irritate the FUCK out of me when people would give me advice about how some cheap wal mart face wash would "clear me up" or just assume that I was dirty and gross and "didn't wash my face" because I had acne. Fuckkkk those people because they will never understand what it's like to suffer from genetic persistent acne that will not go away.

Have you checked out the forums on Acne.org ? That site helped me TREMENDOUSLY when I was going through my journey with acne and accutane. So much help and support on that website. 

Take care and good luck. If you have any other questions plz feel free to let me know and id be happy to help you. ,4,4,0
Without seeing your skin, what you are describing sounds like it could either be cystic of papules (acne) that just has not come to a head. Where are they located on your face? And what are you currently using to treat it?,2,2,0
Probably closed comedones. Mine never surface, so I have to extract them or they will be there for months or years.

I don't recommend doing this at home unless they never resolve on their own and as long as you know what you're doing, though.,1,1,0
Visine eye drops seem to work during the day to reduce redness a little but I know that has no healing properties,1,1,0
Yes, a spot/blemish treatment is used to spot treat pimples, you only apply it to the active acne not the entire face.,1,1,0
Yes, but it's generally used more for the occasional spot. I'm not sure how effective it will be for treating acne.

Also make sure you only use a bit, don't over do it as it can be very drying.,1,1,0
I find that the more frequently I consume probiotics, the less I break out. I've been very good about drinking or eating probiotic foods this month and I only had one small spot appear in the week before my period when I usually break out in multiple places on my chin and cheeks. 

The other thing I've been experimenting with is a light facepack with milk Kefir once a week and a raw honey wash. This was after my Irish father in law told me that his mother and sisters grew up washing their faces with buttermilk and had lovely, young looking skin well into their 50s. It has also helped lighten some of the old acne scars, but I haven't been doing it long enough to have data on this... Maybe a few more months. 

Bonus: Kefir has also been helping me with seasonal bouts of flaky, itchy scalp, with the added benefit of moisturizing and conditioning my hair. I used to do kombucha rinses that helped with this also. ,2,2,0
I tried VSL#3 for a month, which seems to be the best one out there. I think it had a marginal positive effect on my acne. The main thing I found was that I just got very sensitive to tasting sugar in my diet that and killing the sugar cravings meant I nearly eliminated it in my diet, which is probably what caused the effect on my acne. ,2,2,0
i started taking the jarrow formula 25billion probiotics along with a 5 LOX inhibitor every single morning faithfully and i saw a dramatic decrease in my inflammatory spots after about a month. i also stay away from dairy, but i began that before the probiotics and anti-inflammatory and didnt see as much of a difference
,1,1,0
Only use it only on the spots, usually once a day, twice if need be. If it starts to burn them use less and use it less often. It may dry your skin out. Works really well for me though. ,2,2,0
Use on areas affected by acne (so if you have a few pimples on your cheeks, put the bp all over your cheeks rather than just precisely on the pimples,2,2,0
Just be careful, physical exfoliation can cause greater damage sometime. I'm not sure how harsh a pumice stone is, so it may be fine! 

And yeah I second the thing about active acne... that would not be pretty.

Glad your acne has cleared up though. That feel great.

Out of interest, have you looked into what red marks you have? 

It's likely either PIE or PIH. Hyper-pigmentation is another term. I have hyper-pigmentation as well, and it's annoying as hell when my acne is gone!,2,2,0
I'm a pharmacy tech and I've never seen spironolactone in a topical form. I suppose it can be compounded (which I assume your dermatologist does). I had really great success with the medication as well for my acne, although I took it orally like most people. It was the only thing that ever worked for me.,2,2,0
Where can i find this in a topical version! I would love to try it,1,1,0
Thanks for sharing! Let us know if you continue to see good results from this. Very interested. ,1,1,0
Guys what is spironolactone? I've seen so much about it the past few days here! ,1,1,0
Interesting question - I would recommend talking to your dermatologist about other options or medicines you could use at home. 

These type of procedural interventions, like liquid nitrogen, are much higher risk for complications like major skin infection so I would not recommend experimenting on your own.,1,1,0
Stop the antibiotics. It definitely ruins the candida and flora balance in your body, allowing fungus and other bad things to run rampant. Antibiotics for acne should never be taken long term bc they wreak havoc on the body for this specific reason ,2,2,0
Too early. It took 3+ months for me to get legit results.,2,2,0
Keep going.

I think a lot of the time people don't give acne treatments enough time to work. I always gave up on antibiotics after three months and literally a month later I was 85% clear. 

,2,2,0
I've been on it for about a month 4 or 5 months. I would describe the effect as a containment of acne rather than an actual cure. By that I mean you will still break out and get pimples and redness, but it won't be nearly as severe as it would be without retina. I used the clindanycin too but stopped after a month because I think it smells weird. ,1,1,0
Hi, I'm a nutrition student.

No your diet isn't good enough. You have to remember that it's not just about eating suagry but foods that increase blood sugar.

Foods like bread, cause acne because they raise the blood sugar which increases sebum production.

You will see a benefit to getting rid of dairy but not see it completely disappear.

I encourage you to try a high fat vegan diet. Vegan because multiple studies show that animal proteins can trigger an enzyme called M-TOR which not only increases sebum production, but makes your pores larger and essentially super sebum producing factories.

If there anything you do with your life today,

Hey - so a few things. First of all if you don't feel like you can have that conversation about the pros and cons with your dermatologist I would say you need to find a new doctor. 

Second you mention that you have tried creams - but have you tried higher dose topical retinoids? I can't give specific medical advice but in general higher potency topicals work really well if you use them consistently, sometimes with oral antibiotics. 

Anyway I would recommend finding a good family medicine doctor or dermatologist that is willing to discuss all the options with you. ,2,2,0
Accutane could be your best bet at this point as the scarring is starting to develop and any topical treatments now would only help alleviate the new acne lesions.

Just be sure that your doc orders the needed tests, most importantly liver enzymes, prior to starting Accutane.

All the best to you and let us know how it goes, whichever path you choose.,2,2,0
Strongly considering Accutane, went to a dermatologist, was told my face was bad enough to try it. However, she launched straight into suggesting Accutane with no alternative solutions. I've tried creams and pills before with no significant effect, oxy pads have long stopped working, and I've tried to cut down on dairy and sugar, however I've never truly stuck to it. The side effects of Accutane also concern me, and I don't want to take an unnecessary risk when there could be a safer and simpler alternative. ,1,1,0
Laser surgery is the best way. If you can't afford it then look into Vitamin C serum, Tretinoin cream or ask your derma for prescription scar gel/cream. ,5,5,0

Yes acne scarring is very common but there are a few things you can do. First of all many will just fade with time and good skin care. If that doesn't seem to be the case you can often get rid of some shallow ones with some topical medicines like prescription topical retinoids, some deeper ones may require procedures like microdermabrasion.,2,2,0
Try 10% benzoyl peroxide like Oxy or Noczema. They are stronger and may dry out your skin so make sure you moisturizer after washing your face. You can also wash your face with the 10% benzoyl peroxide cleanser first then wash your face last using a moisturizing cleanser like cetaphil or CeraVe. Also try cutting back on dairy and sugars, and even carbs (it's not easy) but that may also help clear up skin. Good luck :)  ,1,1,0
I have tried every product under the sun and this is what has been working really well for me lately:
1. Wash your face with "Yes to Tomatoes Detoxifying Charcoal Cleanser" - charcoal attaches itself to dirt and oil deep in your pores and brings it to the surface.
2. Spot treat with pure tea tree oil (this seriously shrinks pimples so quickly).
3. Moisturize with 100% organic jojoba oil - it fights acne bacteria, doesn't clog pores, and makes skin super moisturized so that your skin doesn't flake and clog your pores even more.
4. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. The redness in your face will go down significantly and prevent breakouts.

I used to only use 10% Oxy Benzoyl Peroxide for 7-8 years once a day and only had some acne occurrences on my nose/jaw line. But recently I had some major breakouts and decided to change that method.

Starting in July I stopped using Benzoyl and started doing -

* Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser twice a day
* Stridex Pads on bad acne spots
* Cerave Moisturizing Cream (Normal - Dry skin)

I started to get too much redness from this routine and switched mid August from this to:

* Paulas Choice Clear Anti Redness Exfoliating Solution 2% Salicylic Acid. (Which is way more tame then Stridex)
* Stopped using a cleanser all together because it was drying my skin and didn't seem to be helping much
* Using Cetaphil Moisturizer when needed
After this pimples were occurring in the same spots, minus the redness but face overall feels better than in July.

Since then I have only been using the Paulas Choice when needed but it seems like Salicylic Acid doesn't really do all that much for my skin. I initially got away from the Benzoyl because it didn't seem to be fixing my issue entirely and I heard it was not so great overall for skin health.

Any advice or input would be amazing on this topic.

Also I recently just hopped back on Green Tea (1-2 cups a day) after stopping it for months. In those months my skin was noticeably more red and I had a lot more sebum than when I was drinking green tea. And now drinking it again, my skin looks and feels a whole lot better! ,2,2,0
Do you have any before and afters you can share? I'm wondering if applying too many products has aggravated my skin ,1,1,0
Looks like the cleanser was causing. Reakouts,1,1,0
Differin is brilliant. It's a much milder retinoid than retin a, tazorac etc, so that means it's gentler on the skin whilst having the same effect.

I've used Differin for about 16 months, although last year I went on accutane and used Differin sparingly throughout my treatment. It's kept my acne at about 70-75% clear but I feel now my skin is so used to it that I maybe need to take the purge and try retin-a since it's stronger and I can't get Differin 0.3% in Scotland.

Anyway, I'd say go for it.. give it at least 12 to 16 weeks before quitting. Purge wise, yeah you probably will breakout but that phase is different for everybody. I didn't breakout that much on it compared to a retinoid called Isotrex I was on. 
I would recommend obviously using it for 1 night one week, 2 nights the following week and for 3 nights the third etc to get your skin used to it since it will make your skin peel quite a bit. ,3,3,0
I've been using it for several years. It works pretty well. Not perfect, but very good. The hardest part of dealing with acne is finding the right acne meds for you. Everybody's different and it takes time to figure out what works and what doesn't. You're gonna have to give it several weeks to see if it's the right prescription for you.,4,4,0
I never really noticed a purge phase when i used it for a year or 2? I think it made like non white head acne turn into white heads. ,2,2,0
If you have not tried Differin, it's available OTC. Diet is not a cure all. You should not discontinue topicals. They take awhile to show results.,2,2,0
I would say topical in addition to a healthy diet would be better. Personally, I'm lactose intolerant, so cutting out dairy made a huge difference.,2,2,0
Diet did nothing for me until I went high fat and low carb to keep blood sugar levels low, also I switched to only washing with water in the morning and then was a massive game changer (and using a hand towel for my face and a separate towel for my body),1,1,0
I'm in my mid 20s and have never had acne as an issue. Currently using exposed skin care and clindamycin as a wipe 2x a day since last week. This has not prevented new breakouts from forming which is about 2-3 new small whiteheads a day!

Help! :( my self-esteem is tanking.

I've been using 5% BP as a spot treatment for the past 3 months now.,1,1,0
How often do you change your pillowcase? I suggest a fresh side/pillowcase every night (=changing it every other day). I second the suggestion about your phone. Consider only talking on the phone with headphones and wiping your phone down with an alcohol wipe once a day.,1,1,0
I didn't start mine specifically for acne, but I think the standard amount of time to find out side effects is about 3 months. It takes a bit for your body to get used to it. ,3,3,0

I understand your pain my friend. Don't worry, it gets better! 
If accutane isn't an option, ask your dermatologist for tazorac. It's a topical retinoid that has a similar strength to accutane. 
Also, i found cutting down on sugar and dairy helped with reducing severity of my breakouts. 
If you have any other questions just PM me! ,2,2,0
Hey guys. My skin has been breaking out, my texture is messed up, and I basically have no idea what to do anymore.

For personal reasons, I'd prefer not to be on accutane. 

Does anyone else have this kind of acne and have any suggestions? I currently use the Kiehl's Calendula face wash and toner and I use L'oreal's Hydra Genius with Hyaluronic acid as a moisturizer. I use tea tree oil as a spot treatment. 

Any advice is welcome. ,1,1,0

I‚Äôm not familiar with the products you are using other than tea tree oil. For me, I am very sensitive to perfumes in soaps and lotions and they often cause me to break out. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but I stick to cetaphil lotion and cleanser. My derm and gp both recommended that for my acne. I did try tea tree oil as a spot treatment and while it worked to dry out the zit, it left me very red and flaky. Now I just use an over the counter benzoyl peroxide on my active zits at night. I also use a prescription for topical retin a nightly (technically I put retin a on first, then a thin layer of cetaphil lotion if my skin is feeling dry, then benzoyl peroxide last). Hang in there, acne is tough to get rid of but you will get through it!,1,1,0
have you tried taking a look at your diet? diet is pretty effective at clearing acne. ,1,1,0
Honestly I used to be like all these commenters grasping at straws at every little thing. Then after 8 years of trying literally every single oral and topical product and every single lifestyle and diet chafe I decided to go on accutane. I would highly recommend anyone to go on it. The stress acne brings you and will continue to bring you are harder on your body than anything accutane can do to you l. It's really over blown as far as side effects go.   Just get it over with once and for all!,1,1,0
I have moderate acne and the best skin I've ever had was when I went dairy free. I tried it fairly strictly for 3 weeks and noticed a difference almost immediately. I cut out all cheese butter yogurt and milk. I subbed it with almond milk and usually used olive oil or coconut oil for cooking. I noticed about a 60 percent reduction in acne in only 2 weeks and my skin had a visible healthier glow. Eventually I missed my cheese and cream in my coffee and the other health benefits of yogurt. My skin is back to being bad again and I'm on accutane lol. Thinking of trying dairy free again. 
Have you tried chocolate almond milk to sub? It's fantastic. But make sure you remember all the other dairy products in your diet that could be contributing. I found cutting dairy was even more effective in changing my skin than upping water intake (although I noticed a lot of other benefits with that too).,2,2,0
Although cutting dairy out won't completely solve your acne issues, there is a good chance it will help. The times when I have been dairy free or just didn't eat much dairy overall is when my skin was at its best. Keep in mind that cutting out dairy isn't a cure-all and that a good skincare routine is essential in order to control acne. Some people benefit more from removing dairy from their diet than others, but there is no harm in trying it out! ,1,1,0
Dairy really isn't good for your body in most respects. 

I've been dairy-free 2 years and it's made a huge difference. That combined with Zinc supplementation has cleared it up almost completely. I still get the occasional spot due to stress. ,1,1,0
Ever since Accutane, the only time I breakout is when I have a lapse in self control and consume dairy or chocolate. I'm also lactose intolerant so I'm pretty sure dairy causes a reaction throughout my body that shows up on my face.,1,1,0
Thats 1. Not very bad 2.not wildly noticeable. 

Now, it may be cystic meaning its under the skin and very very painful. Best advice is dont touch it. Just dont touch it. And remember: dont touch it. :) 

Coming from a guy who would get quarter sized pussy cysts regularly dead center chin, same spot every time. 

Ps get checked for a staph infection! My mom is still dealing with acne!! Its gotten SIGNIFICANTLY better bc a doc finally took a closer look and realized shes had a minor staph infection for years now that was simply assumed to be acne by so many others. ,4,4,0
Have you been to a derm? How old is the issue? What do you use on your skin to wash?,2,2,0
Try something really basic like salycilic acid at night, a basic light moisturizer like cetaphil  and sunscreen. ,1,1,0
Agreed that this doesn't look too bad but that it is worth having checked out by a doctor. You don't need a dermatologist - a good family medicine doctor should be able to handle that easily. 

Although I can't give specific medical advice - in general the don't touch it pop/pick advice I'm seeing is very good. Salicylic acid is helpful although it isn't as great at some of the deeper stuff. Longer term some prescription retinoids are considered among the best options.,1,1,0
It sounds like your diet is crappy in general. Eating clean is worth clear skin to me 100x over. I'd eat just celery sticks every day if that's what it took.,4,4,0
You can't totally eliminate sugar from your diet, but you should keep your intake to only 20grams a day. It will take discipline to get to that level. Remove the refine sweets and do eat more good food stuff.,1,1,0
I'm no expert but I think its probably your acne products. Also I would try fragrance free stuff if you have sensitive skin or in general. Your habits seem fine it just might be the chemicals from the products you use. I say keep it simple with a facial wash and moisturizer. You can try Neutrogena, St Ives, Cerave, Cetaphil, Basis soap bar, etc. I feel like a lot of dermatologists recommend Cerave or Cetaphil mostly. Exercise often like 30 minutes a day would be good. Drink 8 cups of water would be great.,1,1,0

Sunscreen! As often as you can. Doesn't matter if it's cloudy. And then a retinoid or salycilic acid can help increase the turnover rate of your skin. I had very similar pigmentation recently after a massive bout of hormonal cystic acne and also had a bit of a picking problem.  I realized touching it at all was hindering the healing. So don't pick at any flakey skin. Keep it as hydrated as possible and most of all, give it time. Your skin is healing! That's awesome. It will fade much more quickly with those steps.

I went and got a chemical peel, it makes it kind of tough to go out the following 5 days but it really really really helped my hyper pigmentation and my skin was similar to yours and mine was even a little worse,1,1,0
I've dealt with acne since age 14 (19 now) although my skin has gotten better, I still get a pimple or 2 every other week that leaves a mark that lasts for WEEKS EVEN MONTHS !!! .. my skin sucks ass at healing acne marks!

TIME is your best bet. I've ruined/worsened marks by trying all types of products throughout those 5 years. All I use now is Cetaphil once a day to make sure I ''clean'' my face 100%  before I leave to school/work and thoroughly wash my face with only water after getting home.

My brother, had similar pigmentation but on his forehead. He didn't wash his face for days at a time and is CLEAR without a single mark. (I dont have enough balls to do this),1,1,0
Pure vitamin C serums. Hydrating, exfoliating and clears spots and blemishes. Make sure to use a moisturizer after it.

There are a number of spot treatment creams you can try as well although those can be drying.

But you can forget about it if you're going to be out in the sun without sunscreen. I doubt there's going to be any result from anything at all when there are harmful UV rays darkening your pigmentation every day.,1,1,0
Try not washing your face directly for 10 days. No Acne creams, face scrubs, or masks. No touching your face and no popping zits. Just let your body work it out. The more oil you remove from your face the more your body makes. ,1,1,0
if you are willing to try it, I've had a complete 180 on my skin's years of hyper-pigmentation by using 2 things: 

1. Premier Dead Sea facial cleanser with micro grains (a gentle dermabrasion over time to help remove dead skin cells every day)


2. Pure rosehip oil (clears blemish scars/spots/discoloration)


both are cheap - both have transformed my skin from acne scarring like yours to nearly clear in the last 2.5 months!,0,0,0
I noticed no difference for me from quitting coffee alone. I had acne well before I ever drank any to be honest. Some people are more reactive to certain things though. I easily made the switch to spearmint tea to treat my hormonal acne. I was used to having a cup of something warm and tea was a better replacement and when I saw results I didn't miss the coffee at all. ,1,1,0
Coffee used to break me out when I used flavored creamers but once I switched to unsweetened almond milk I stopped having a reaction to coffee. I don't know what you put in your coffee, but it's just a thought.,1,1,0
When I started using tretinion, my skin definitely purged even though I was using chemical peels before that. Trentinoin works by increasing your cell turnover rate, which in turn causes the skin to purge. So unfortunately you will likely deal with more breakouts, just hang in there and stick with it. ,1,1,0
I would say try an electric razor! I'm a woman so I don't have any advice on a good option/price point, but I can imagine missing the first layer to your skin could hurt it. 

Definetly would advise using things specifically designed for the face as well, a good acne face wash could help. ,1,1,0
I'm no expert but I feel like you should see a dermatologist. I would use shaving cream for men, maybe something without fragrance. If you haven't already, you should consider a facial wash and moisturizer depending on your skin type.,1,1,0
I'm using Aveeno Active Naturals sulfate free shampoo. I asked the company what the ph level of it was since I didn't want a shampoo too alkaline. You want something between a ph of 5 and 7.

Morning and night I use Phisoderm Fragrance Free Cream Cleanser. Also in the morning I apply on Yes To Tomatoes daily pore scrub (clear skin). 

Philips One Blade is a nice wet/dry electric razor that replaced my Wahl and I use a Mach3 Turbo razor to get any leftovers.

esthetician here! what do they apply to your brows post waxing? aloe? toner? lotion? it could also be the wax they use! don't be afraid to ask them about their products on your next appointment. ,3,3,0
I would *not* clean your brows with alcohol as another commenter suggested. That will only irritate the skin further (while rubbing alcohol isn't toxic for the skin, applying it to already irritated skin on the face...not the best idea IMO). Have you ever tried threading? Personally, that is what keeps the breakout/irritation post brow shaping at bay for me. If you continue to wax, maybe have your skin freshly cleansed with rose water or micelles water and make sure to soothe it afterwards as well. Obviously a reputable salon that is keeping up sanitary requirements is also key. ,1,1,0
Esthetician here as well.  I would make sure your face is totally clean before getting waxed, and have them use witch hazel afterwards. Never get breakouts when that method is used. ,1,1,0
The outbreak is cause by the wax solution is not sanitized.  Try cleaning your brows with alcohol so after.,-1,-1,0

Idk man. I'm 21 and I still have it. But it comes in waves. I randomly get awful breakouts with 15 pimples all active and painful at once. Luckily having clear-ish skin (by that I mean, I think my skin looks great until I put my contacts in, so it's not so noticeable from a distance) more often than not. The problem I'm having is actually not so much the active pimples as it is the acne scars, seeing as I have 10 years worth accumulated on my face, however it was worst between 17-19. :/

My housemate was complaining about one tiny pimple, whereas she pretty much has porcelain skin. I asked her what her routine for her face is and she said "literally nothing...just splash some water on it whenever I shower." No cleanser, no toner, no scrubs, no masks, no non-comedogenic lotions, no nothing." 

I've heard that having acne means you're likely to not get wrinkles until you're older than average...but I have no proof of this. 

If yours is strictly on your chin, maybe it would get a bit better if you keep yourself from putting your hands on your chin when your elbow's on the table? Like when you're studying, sitting in class, etc.,3,3,0
In deep middle age and my issues have changed over the years, but I still get the occasional cystic lesi√≥n (currently on minocycline XR) and struggle with blackheads, whiteheads and clogged pores.

I was put on oxytetracycline antibiotic last dec and it worked for about 1.5 months then it stopped working and i started getting cystic spots back, my doctor changed my antibiotic to erythromycin and it worked for 4 months, no cystic spots until last week when iv had two on my chin appear so its clear iv became resistent to these antibiotics so i would say you have maybe become resistent to doxycycline or maybe due to the dosage being reduced. Either way i wouldn't want to be taking antibiotics long term as this does not do any good for your body. I have a derm appt for November. Can you go back and see ur derm? Nikki,1,1,0

I went through the same routines and problem as you. Stop everything you're doing. Go to your local store and look for a soap called 'basis' it has no dyes or harsh chemicals. Use the soap twice or even three times a day if needed. Be consistent and your acne will clear up ,1,1,0

Hey, 19/M. I am one week into my 6 month accutane treatment. I have had mild/severe acne for around 3.5 years (I got one cyst every 1.5 weeks, with mild but steady breakout). I tried 4 antibiotics and 3 topicals before I was referred to a dermatologist on the NHS and prescribed accutane. For people with mild accutane I feel you need to jump through a few hoops by trying different antibiotics (which may still work, my first cleared me up for 2 months!!) before a derm will look at an accutane prescription from a time POV instead of a severity POV. I hope this helps and I can answer any questions. I know accutane treatment of mild acne is a grey area so I am happy to clear your mind on the issue :),3,3,0
I'm 21/F and I've been on Isotretinoin twice @18 and @19 (thinking about a 3rd). I've never had really bad cystic acne, but like you it was just really persistent and eventually it started spreading to other parts of my body so I was fed up and started Zenatane. I was on 40mg/day and my skin cleared up right away while on it. Like my skin was so flawless I thought it was too good to be true. After 5 months my Derm took me off of it, but after 6 months of being off of it, it started to come back (not as bad though). The second time was interrupted because I was traveling out of the country and it was hard to fill the prescription/get labs done abroad. 
To date my acne is SIGNIFICANTLY better than it used to be, however, it still is persistent and I just want it completely gone. 
Do you have an questions regarding the drugs and my experience? ,1,1,0
Do you have a zinc deficiency?,1,1,0
What type of zinc is in your multi vitamin? I can't remember the name but all I know there is a certain type. There's a type of diaper cream that is high in zinc From the research I did it apparently works amazing on cystic acne.,1,1,0
Change your pillow case every night (you can get 2 nights per pillow case by flipping it).

Stop eating gluten. (Kudos for ditching dairy and sugar).

See a dermatologist.

Zinc supplements are not all created equal and you want to make sure you choose one with a bioavailable form of zinc. This may not be "cheap" but you're otherwise just making expensive pee because low quality zinc supplements don't do much for you.

Increase whatever amount of water you're drinking per day. STOP drinking all soda immediately. This includes diet soda.,1,1,0
Don't touch your face. Get an exfoliating scrub. exercise more. see a dermatologist when you can. ,1,1,0
I also use the same nacinamide serum every morning before applying my sun screen and I never have noticed any bad cystic spots because of it, but everyone is different. I have extremely oily skin and get cystic acne fairly often, until recently I've notice it's subsided a bit. Do you happen to rest your hand on certain parts of your face during the day? I am extremely guilt of that and I've been trying my best to stop, it can be difficult. Also do you wear makeup? Sometimes when I try out a new concealer that has ingredients that my skin doesn't get along with, I'll break out only where I used the new product. 

I do think they have a fairly limited ingredient list so maybe do some research on those and see if there could possibly be one that could cause a cystic reaction. I love cosdna.com :) I also have tried to blot my face as much as I can, even with just toilet paper when I'm out of blotting sheets and I think it has helped my skin a little, although I don't know if it's influenced my cystic acne not being so terrible at the moment and I still have very large pores on my cheeks.  

I honestly don't know if the niacinamide does anything for my skin; I got it because I read it can help people with oily skin stay matte through the day and I'm still just a oily but since I bought it and I enjoy it as a light application to hydrate my skin, I'll use it until its empty, but I don't know if I'll repurchase. ,1,1,0
I agree that you should check it out on cosdna. The Glossier Super Bounce and The Ordinary Niacinamide have different ingredients, so your skin might be reacting to one of the different ingredients. ,1,1,0

Unfortunately it‚Äôs not going to go away until it‚Äôs lanced/excised. Please don‚Äôt attempt to excise it at home, it won‚Äôt end well for you.  A dermatologist doesn‚Äôt have to do it though. You may be able to go to a clinic or just to your regular GP to excise it. They might try to lance (‚Äúpop‚Äù) it first to try to avoid scarring, but there‚Äôs a pretty good chance it‚Äôll come back again and they‚Äôll have to excise it.

Cortisone shot. Depending on where you go may cost anywhere between $70-$150 per cyst. It's a quick solution but it doesn't cure it. Look into cortisone shots for quick fix. ,1,1,0

If it's already scarred there isn't much he can do about it. No soap in the world will fix it. Cream isn't helpful for severe scarring.

I've heard a lot of people here talk about dermarolling, which I've never done (IMO it looks really fucking painful), but could be an option.

I've done laser scar removal before but it requires multiple treatments and will probably be prohibitively expensive if he's doing his entire back (I did both cheeks and it was about $500 each time). It does work but IMO would not recommend it unless he is extremely insecure *and* wealthy.,2,2,0

Benzoyl Peroxide 5% twice a day with moisturizer. Wait a month or so. You should see some improvement. If you're still not happy see a dermatologist or doctor and you could start trying some antibiotics like tetracycline or minocycline. You could also try some topical clindamycin. It worked good for me. I'm your age but male. I've just kind of acepted that there is no cure and I just have to wait it out.,1,1,0
Yes! A lot of hormonal imbalances are from insulin resistance which has everything to do with diet. I'm thin and have never struggled with my weight but I was a carb and sugar addict! I haven't had dairy in about five months and just recently cut out all grains/starches and am doing a low glycemic basically keto diet and I'm going to step it up even more this week and do no fruits for a while. I've also started exercising four days a week! I would seriously recommend trying to fix it naturally before putting toxic stuff in/on your body. At least give it a month and if you see absolutely no improvement then try a derm. But really, they've done more harm than good for me personally. Many people do have success with them, though ,4,4,0
Have you tried changing your diet? I'm going through the same issue right now (acne all my life) and dermatologist after dermatologist have just made things worse!

not about acne, but your sunglasses are a bit big on your face.,1,1,0
So I'd say the products sound pretty harsh. Washing twice a day can feel good, but the body needs time to settle and rebuild sebum. And witch hazel practically ripped my skin off!

Try the La Roche Posay Effaclar Duo, the biggest mistake to do with oily skin is to use clarifying products that strip the skin of its natural moisture and in turn make the skin produce more sebum.
Use a gentle non-stripping cleanser and follow up with Thayer's witch hazel toner. Use the Effaclar treatment at night, start off with a couple of days a week and slowly increase to daily. Use a light weight moisturizer with spf in the morning. ,2,2,0

I have had problems with acne ever since high school, I have naturally oily skin and have always had a job that required me to get greasy and dirty pretty much daily. I always thought that my job was the main culprit but now I haven't had to do work like that for 2 months and it hasn't changed at all. I used a foaming cleanser by cerave 2x a day, morning and nights but that is about it. My diet is pretty healthy, does not consist of hardly any refined sugars, maybe 1 soda a week, I drink water 99% of the time. I workout on average 4 days a week. Haven't shaved in a couple of weeks so I dont think it has anything to do with that. Only spots it's really in is both cheeks and every once in awhile a couple of spots will come up on my chin or forehead. Any advice would be greatly  appreciated! I feel like I'd be much much happier with a clear face. Thank you!,1,1,0
See if you can get in to see your derm. They can give you a steroid injection that will clear it up super fast. Call and explain you have an event coming up and lots of derm will fit you in. ,7,7,0
I would avoid popping it. I would rather look worse for a week than for years because of scarring ,2,2,0
Don't pop it! It'll look worse for the event and the weeks to come. Either go to your derm or get a concealer.,3,3,0
Thank you all for the suggestions. Much appreciated. I've decided not to pop it. Will see a dermatologist today. 

The event is that I'm going to start my 10 day holiday trip in 2 days. I used a lot of my savings on this trip and it's disheartening to see this happen just before the trip. I haven't had such huge acne for 5 months straight. I suppose I just have to live with it and shy away from having any fun. It's going to be a very embarrassing holiday. Sigh! :( ,3,3,0
See a derm about this.

I pop pimples like this but I know my skin and how my face heals and my pimples never come to a head on their own. I educated myself on how to properly pop and drain mine. You know your own skin, so don't try that unless you 100% know what you're doing and what the outcome will be.

All that said, it's on the side of your face and so your holiday pics won't be too bad. Look straight on to the camera in pics or slightly turn your "bad" side away from the camera so it's not photographed. Everyone here knows that our acne is 100% worse and more visible to us than the rest of the world. No one cares as much as you do, promise!,3,3,0
People here say wise things. Don't pop it. Also 2 days can make a big difference, at least with the acne i have. ,2,2,0

Try crushing aspirin and mixing it with a few drops of water (into a paste) then apply on it directly for 10 minutes.

If it does not reduce the swelling by tomorrow morning then your best bet is to visit your derm for a steroid injection as GregariousUnicorn suggested.,1,1,0
God so many times i sat inside instead of doing something.  No one sees what you see. Its going to be ok, especially with some friends! ,4,4,0
Dont cancel. Stay with it. Do you know that clinical trials for acne are 3 months long? It takes this long to see statistically significant results. And people mostly care about their own faces and not others so dont feel down, you probably notice more than anybody else.  Just stay with it. Even this will pass. I guarantee it. ,2,2,0
I could use the facial wash first, just as you would any other face wash. Then dry your face off afterwards. Get a cotton ball or cotton pad, damp it with the toner, and lightly rub it over your face. It'll help get the remaining dirt and oil out of your pores!,2,2,0
Facial wash comes first. Then use the toner after you've gotten out of the shower to help hydrate your skin and control sebum production. You don't have to rinse toner off, it's supposed to be swiped over your skin with a cotton pad and left on. Allow a minute for the toner to dry, then follow up with a moisturizer if your skin needs it.

I use toner twice a day... once after a shower, and again before bed after removing my makeup.,1,1,0

I am on the caveman regime, at the same time I started a vegan diet and juicing greens. It has been a year and a half now and my acne is about 85% better than before. I don't do anything to my face except for washing it with cold water in the shower. ,2,2,0
10% is strong af, so it's not too surprising your skin is somewhat irritated. You can keep using it, just make sure you use a moisturizer, preferably a gel one with some slight cooling capabilities, about 5 minutes after the BP application,8,8,0
So, I tried persa gel last night, after washing my face with Effaclar bar soap, and now my face is with these red spots where I applied the product. Is there anything to make it better? Should I continue to use it? Thanks!,1,1,0
Your skin looks over exfoliated and dry. I only know this because I'm experiencing the same thing right now after a bad chemical peel and a harsh cleanser. I'd moisturize and be gentle to your skin for at least a couple of weeks and then slowly try reintroducing your actives. ,1,1,0
Studies show 10% is not more effective than 2.5 BPO monotherapy.,1,1,0
Mainly make sure you use sunscreen - 10% BP is very strong and your skin can burn if you dont use sunscreen. You may get used to BP after some time - reduce use or switch to something else. ,1,1,0
You are allergic to it. I had this as well. ,1,1,0
 Hey I know this is a bit late,  but this is EXACTLY what my face looked like after I started.  I did it once every three days or so. Put on some calming moisturizer, use a clean mask (no whacky ingredients), coconut oil will help calm, drink water. When it clears try again. Process, but it's netter than ripping off skin (because it may peel.),1,1,0
I've had a lot of luck with 1) changing my pillow case frequently, sometimes putting a new towel onto it overnight, 2) using those oxy wipes, and 3) taking advantage of charcoal masks. I'm no expert but since I've done these things my face has cleared up a lot. I hope this helps,2,2,0

Ok - anything Avene if you have more sensitive skin. Also, NUXE oil is a French body/hair/face oil and it's a French holy grail staple. I use it everywhere - it's more of a dry oil too, so nothing too oily to ruin clothes, sheets, etc;

If you can - German Nivea creme. Europeans die over this. Make sure it says "Made in Hamburg" on the backside so it's real. 

I also love the Vichy LiftActiv Supreme Collection. The serum and night cream are amazing and smell great.  

If you'll ever be in France just stop into a "Pharmacie" that's where all the awesome skincare is! ,1,1,0
Even for those who don't have acne, it's important to start a skincare routine. Let's start easy and simple.

Cleanser: Choose a low ph one so you don't dehydrate your skin. Cosrx Low PH Cleanser is a popular one.

Toner: I personally use Skinfood Tea Tree Toner, because Tea Tree is good for acne.

Moisturizer: Nature Republic Aloe Vera Gel is popular amongst oily-acne prone skin people.

Exfoliate: Stridex pads in the red box are heavenly. They tame my acne like no other. Do this step only 2-3 times a week, because it's a chemical exfoliant and over exfoliating your skin leads to different problems. 

Spot Treatment: (optional) A lot of people like using Benzoyl Peroxide Cream to spot treat pimples. I'm putting this step as optional because unfortunately BP Cream can be ineffective for some people (like me.) If you get this, buy one with 2.5% because any higher is more drying but equally effective.,2,2,0
Stop eating acne causing food aka sugar, dairy (milk) try and eat more veggies . My story is a bit similar to yours. I don't think you have to worry because this happens somethimes . Try to make a dermatologist appointment .

Hey, I've been/am still in the same boat, have had acne for the past 7 years and not much has really worked. 

Having said that your skincare routine is a good start, But maybe try and work in a larger routine, incorporating a few things that will help with skin tone and redness as well. 

At the moment my routine looks like;

Morning: gentle foam wash to help with oiliness, toner, moisturizer.
Night: rice foam whitening scrub from skin food, toner, whitening serum, moisturizer, eye cream 
And every 3rd day a face mask to help with blackheads and clear up pores. 

And careful with the benzoyl peroxide wash, Benz is great for acne but it can actually increase redness so if you're using that for a while and see an increase in redness or 0 decrease, maybe switch to a gentler wash/scrub for a while that is meant to help with discoloration and hyperpigmentation. 

The reason I have so many brightening/whitening things in my routine is because it seems to do a great job at evening out redness with the rest of my skin  

Good luck!,1,1,0
Your acne isn't even bad. Don't worry about it. Just keep a simple skin care routine.,1,1,0
I've heard that a lot of people like Panoxyl but that should be one of the last things you try. You could try differin its otc now for your whole face. But I would recommend just using normal facial wash and a moisturizer. I found that using moisturizer kinda helped my acne a bit. You could potentially be allergic to your shaving cream? I just think sometimes the answer may be simpler than you would think. ,1,1,0
I had sever acne and only thing that worked for me was accutane.. i still get a pimple every once in a while but it is much better now... as for your scarring i ll link you a youtube channel with truly excellent information that isn't bias and isn't trying to sell you anything... and most importantly is an actual doctor. I recommend going through his videos as it helped me understand all the possible treatments for scarring.

I have almost the same problem! The texture of my skin is pretty damaged and I have multiple scars on my cheeks and chin. The solutions that works the best for me right now are cleansers and with probiotics; they keep your skin from getting dry and flaky and keeps cystic acne down to a minimum.  I'm still experimenting with probiotic masks and lotions but they are showing the best results I've seen for my acne in a while. Hope this helps!,2,2,0
Please give accutane a shot,1,1,0
I had cystic acne for years, I went on several different kinds of birth control and that eventually stopped the cysts, but the rest of my acne remained. I'm currently 4 months into accutane and I think it's working for me, it might be worth a shot for you.,2,2,0
Congrats. I am 15, and clear because Accutane.,1,1,0
I used a similar routine after struggling for many years. I alternated Differin in the PM and BP 10% in the AM. Amazing results with consistency and patience! Congrats!,1,1,0
Oh my god,

I thought this was a question related to smoking. It's niacinamide*** LOL

It has pretty good reviews here and lots of people swear by it. It may cause some red flushing, but from what people have said here, they liked it and said it helped with their acne and red marks ,2,2,0
Studies showed that it is as effective as clindamycin gel for acne. Some showed that it was even more effective than clindamycin after 6/8 weeks of use.

 I think B3 is definitely something worth considering, it is anti-inflammatory, regulates sebum production, tightens pores, and repairs the moisture barrier, it also fades red marks so that's great.

I have seen the rave reviews on many B3 products, but there are  better options than the expensive, small Freederm gel tube. You can get Nicam gel, it's the unbranded version, or any affordable niacinamide serum  that has a simple formula.,1,1,0
Try a gentle/low pH cleanser along with reasonably light moisturiser with benzoyl peroxide as a treatment. If you want to you can add in a mask every week or so. Personally I use la Roche-Posay effaclar cleaner (or the cosrx low pH cleanser), la roche posay effaclar duo/cosrx oil free lotion and the queen Helene mint julep mask. I know a lot of people love cerave too but that's a bit hard to get where I am. Some people also find hydrocolloid patches can help with cystic acne too. It won't be an overnight change but should help in the long run. ,1,1,0
Here's what worked for me:
Cleanser: SK II treatment cleanser
Toner: Thayer's witch hazel toner
Moisturizer: Dr. Jart ceramidin serum in the morning and Sunday Riley Juno oil in the night
Spot treatment: Skinceuticals blemish + age serum
Makeup: Estee lauder nude cushion foundation and/or Amore Pacific cushion foundation,1,1,0
Refined sugar was the culprit for me into my 30s. After reducing to <10 grams / day, much of my acne cleared up. It's tough but not impossible. ,3,3,0

Make sure you aren't using any products that could be breaking you out. You can search up your product(s) at http://www.cosdna.com/ to see how they rate.

But in the case of treating it (just by my own experience, I am in no way a dermatologist!), you can try either of these 3 acne spot treatments: salicylic acid (most commonly used and in drugstores), sulfur(available in drugstores), and benzyl peroxide (rarer to find in stores).

Skincare products I highly recommend (again, my experience): 
cleanser: SheaMoisture Black African Soap (target or amazon), Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc (ZnP) Original Bar Soap (amazon; recommended by my dermatologist)
Toner: Mario Badescu Facial Spray w/ Aloe & Rosewater (!!! this stuff is amazing and a small bottle costs around $6)
Moisturizer: acne.org moisturizer
*You can also search up any drugstore product through the cosDNA link as well!


Another tip: A ton of acne companies provide free trials where you only have to pay for shipping the first time, such as...:
https://curology.com/
https://www.skinkick.com/free-trial/


I am currently trying Curology right now and it's been great (I'm in no way sponsered by them!) and I think it's a great option to try out if your skin gets worse!


Good luck! Hopefully, it's nothing.,1,1,0
This sort of looks like it could be malassezia folliculitis. If you check my post history you'll see that I posted about my own acne a few weeks ago and the small bumps look similar to what you have. A user suggested the same to me and since I've been following the regimen they recommended it has cleared up significantly. ,1,1,0
Stop shaving with a razor,10,10,0
Edit: I saw small improvements around week 5 but then it all came back and worse than before. ,8,8,0
I used to over-moisturizer and my skin would do that. Now I only moisturizer at night and if my face feels so dry that I can't stand it. I found that if I keep my face on the dryer side I don't get those anymore. It definitely takes some getting used to and it makes it wayyyy harder not to pick, though. ,6,6,0
1. Don't listen to that, it's not true. 
2. What's your exact regimen? I use a combo of differin gel and a homemade drying cream (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.popsugar.com/beauty/DIY-Mario-Badescu-Drying-Lotion-31967088/amp) ...but it all depends on your specific type of acne. Have you seen a dermatologist? ,3,3,0
I think a retinoid like Differin or Tretinoin would work well for you. My doctor told me that it responds really well to the whitehead/pus acne since it helps bring the infection to the surface quickly. If you able to go to doctor, get a prescription for Tret. Even primary care/GP's can prescribe it. My friend got it from a CVS minute clinic. If not, you can buy Differin OTC.,3,3,0
Try differin (and use it daily) ASAP,2,2,0
Good points! Sorry for misleading, didn't mean to. ,2,2,0
Manuka honey mask. Seriously try it. ,2,2,0
Moisturizing too much will dry out your skin do it twice a day and when you shave use a face lotion afterwards i used to have that as well make sure you shave before your hair gets too long too,2,2,0
Epiduo will clear that up. I've been there.,2,2,0
Have you tried doing nothing?,3,3,0
You should stop using the 2% salicylic acid cleanser. Salicylic acid is more effective for blackheads. For inflammatory acne, SA can just be irritating and potentially make the problem worse. 

Acne is not caused by dirty skin and clensers can dry out and irritate the skin. I would stop using the transparent face bar, or any soap or clenser, until your acne clears up. It seems counter-intuitive, but try washing with warm water only.

If you drop the cleansers your face might not need as much moisturizer.

Cetaphil always broke me out. I don't think over-moisturizing is as big of a problem as using the wrong moisturizer.

Try Cerave PM, or ACNE.org's moisturizer. 

Visiting a dermatologist is always your best option.,2,2,0
I would give up the Benzoyl and the salicylic acid. I found my skin was to sensitive for these products and made my acne worse. 

What helped me was a Cetaphil cleanser/moisturizer and tretinoin a topical retinoid cream. 

Also, you should wear a moisturizer that is oil free and has sunscreen. I have found it really helps reduce inflammation. ,1,1,0
Cut out this: üò©‚úäÔ∏èüçÜüí¶üëå,-18,-18,0
One suggestion would be to ask your dermatologist about oral antibiotics. I take Solodyn, and while it hasn't completely eliminated my chest and back acne, it has largely prevented me from getting cysts ("undergrounders").

You can buy body washes with benzoyl peroxide, which works for some people, but those didn't really help me‚Äîand they stained my towels. 

I'm curious what other people have to say!,3,3,0
I'm in the same boat as you (literally went through the same thing with the bc- I felt awful on it, couldn't work off any weight gains and decided that I would rather feel good/be fit, and I would take the acne in stride). Well the acne got worse, and am facing accutane now, but nervous from all of the horror stories. Looking forward to any comments you get!,2,2,0
I took accutane about 2 years ago. Yes it feels like hell. My acne got worse right as I got on it then it got better but my face was red typically and I always had to stay on top of it with moisturizers. My face went from clear to absolutely covered in about 2-3 months before accutane. and my dermatologists said it would keep getting worse unless I took it. The pills feel like a miracle. Yes I would suggest it to anyone who is desperate. I tried everything before, even the harsh stuff. If you react badly (depression or whatever) then just get off. A way I got through it was thinking about how many people have gone through this and came out on the other side happy and by golly I'm just as strong as them lol. Best of luck! Any questions pm me,2,2,0
I took accutane when I was a senior in high school for 5 months. I also had to go on the pill since I am a female and accutane can cause birth defects. I had to go for monthly blood tests to detect pregnancy. My skin got way worse and super dry at first. Make up made it look worse. I also became very sensitive and had serveral crying spells and angry outbursts. I even got so angry once I blacked out and I kicked a hole in the door (this was so out of character for me). I said I wouldn't do accutane again. Now 7 years later my skin is better but I still get hermonal acne around my mouth. :( ,1,1,0
I've had terrible acne for about 10 years now (I am 23, f). I was on accutane when I was about 17 for a year and a half and it worked wonderfully. 
Unfortunately last year it returned and I am now awaiting my appointment to restart treatment. 

It was an absolute god send for me. My skin is my biggest insecurity and to have it totally, completely clear is just so worth it for me.

The downsides I had were obviously the extreme dryness - my lips were so dry it was painful. My skin was so dry it would flake and peel, even if I moisturised. Putting make up on was not fun. I also experienced the worst sunburn of my life whilst on accutane, and have issues with alcohol now due to the effect it had on my  liver. 
I also had to do regular blood tests and sign a form regarding pregnancy - my doctor literally made me write out a statement saying I would not get pregnant. 

Despite all of this it is still the best thing I've ever done for my skin. I have tried everything, I went on birth control specifically to control my acne which didn't help, all the creams, routines and diets you can think of, and accutane is the only thing that has ever worked.

I am now just extra careful when I go in the sun, and extra careful with my drink. I can't wait to restart my treatment and I hope you have great success with it :) 

Also just wanted to add something about one of the side effects being depression. I was absolutely miserable while on it but I do not attribute that to the drug, I was miserable because of the state of my skin, and once it cleared up I was ecstatic. I can't speak for everyone but the depression wasn't a side effect of accutane it was a side effect of acne!,1,1,0
Go to a derm.  Looks hormonal because it's big and looks hard to pop. Which don't ever do that btw. Also I'm a woman so I'm not an expert at male hormones. ,2,2,0
Have you tried Differin?,2,2,0
I've wondered if maybe my acne wash is causing me to break out. When I don't use it though I always feel so greasy. ,2,2,0
Yes. I will only use very gentle cleansers and only ONCE IN A WHILE I'll use something more exfoliating. I've reduced washing to once a day or every other day and have seen improvement. It seems the less products I use, the better off I am. ,2,2,0
This is actually super common. A lot of people break out more from overwashing. I only wash my face once a day, usually to remove makeup and leave it alone the rest of the time and my skin is thriving. Acne is a very VERY individualized thing, different things can work very differently for different people.,2,2,0
It makes no difference whether I use ¬£200 of shit or take off my make-up and go to bed... the only real product I use is jojoba oil as a makeup remover and Ocean Salt by Lush to sluice off the scabs/dry flakes zits leave. It makes me laugh when people say I have acne because I have no routine. Fuck off man.,1,1,0
Idk if this could be your case but from what I've experienced not moisturizing after washing causes my face to overproduce oil and then break outs. I know it kinda sounds counter intuitive to moisturize when you're already oily, but sometimes cleansers strip too much oil. A good gel moisturizer can help prevent it from that happening without over moisturizing and making things greasy. Also products with a good amount of alcohol have made me overproduce oil too. It could be totally different for you, just thought I'd put my two cents in.,1,1,0
Your skin provides enough oils that your cleanser strips off.   That is common. You should get a better cleanser.  Skin reacts badly to high ph in products. ,1,1,0
I'm done trying to find patterns. It seems pretty random and changing your habits doesn't change anything at all. Just do nothing or go for a treatment.,1,1,0

Hi nutrition student here.

Green tea can definitely help acne because it contains a compound that suppresses M-TOR. Which is the main cause of acne.

It also possess extreme antibacterial effects.

There was also a study showing acne was refused by 58% with 2% green tea lotion,2,2,0

I mean its always a good idea to stay hydrated, and green tea tastes pretty good, but I haven't got any experience with that specifically clearing up my skin! ,1,1,0

I have drank 3-4 cups every day for a long long time and it hasn't helped my acne. Cutting sugar from my diet helps a lot though ,1,1,0
Nope. Avid green tea drinker for years. Only thing that's helped my stress related hormonal acne has been reducing stress, changing pillowcases, a good skincare routine, and the critical component (for me), accutane. ,1,1,0
It's generally safe to give a new program at least 8 weeks before deciding if it's working or not. You're probably itching for results, which I totally get, but one week just isn't enough time to judge if it's effective. Wait a month or two and then up the dosage if you need to. ,3,3,0
there are 3 options i discovered through out my life time that work for different people:


benzol peroxide regimen


retinoid cream


accutane


choose one of those and go for it,2,2,0
What birth control are you on? birth control pills, like norgestimate make acne worse specifically for me, it caused cystic acne. I switched to Yasmin and the cysts are very rare now. I still have pimples, but they are mostly whiteheads that I can control with proper skin care.,2,2,0
I highly recommend spironolactone. 
Make sure your birth control is anti androgen like yaz. 
I'm not even on bc but spiro has cleared me. 
,2,2,0
Hey maybe switch dermatologists, bc antibiotics are clearly not working. No it's not gonna be like that forever. There are other things to try, someone said Spiro-something which (i think) blocks hormones that usually cause acne and works for a lot of people, as does Yaz. Accutane is also something worth considering, because that'll definitely knock it right out-- I'm so serious. Only downer is it may be very pricey depending on your insurance. ,2,2,0
Will it be like this forever? I'd like to have clear skin before I start developing wrinkles! And ideally (after 5 years on anti-biotics) I'd like to come off some of the medication!
I wash with Simple face cleanser once a day.,1,1,0
I'm 33 and still get the large cysts on my face. It runs on my moms side of the family. I've taken every antibiotic, cream, pill out there. I still get em. I noticed if I limit my caffeine, sugar and dairy intake, they're not as common. Which sucks because I love all 3 of those things lol

I hope you find something that works for you!,1,1,0
Oh man I have the same problem...always cystic acne on my chin. When will it ever go away...:( ,1,1,0
As other users mentioned, the birth control you are on should be anti androgen. Certain progestins in birth control can act as androgens and make acne worse. You could try accutane if you are desperate. I cannot take accutane due to mental health issues but I did start spironolactone and after 3 months on it I no longer have hormonal acne.,1,1,0
As another commenter has mentioned - get off antibiotics immediately.   

It can be diet related. Anything dairy, white wheat, and high sugar foods are all known potential triggers. It can also be hormonal so you may require hormonal therapy of some sort - taking a blood test will help to rule that out. Lastly, your skin, like mine, might just be extra sensitive to any cleansers. Try doing the caveman routine where you either don't wash your face or wipe it down with toner.,1,1,0
Hi all. Thanks for all your replies. I currently use benzoyl peroxide, and I'm on co-cyprindiol. 
My GP is who kept me on the anti-biotics, we don't go straight to dermatologists here in the UK. I've been thinking for a while that I'll just come off the doxycycline. 
My GP said we could try accutane, but she wanted me to go to a psychiatrist first, due to my history of mental health problems... Which I wasn't keen on!

Guess I'm just fed up of being really spotty, and not having the teenager excuse.,1,1,0
I've had similar acne my whole adult life, but I recently cleared it up by doing the following:
1) switching from foaming face wash to a facial bar soap (I use Purpose) No idea what's in the face washes that's missing from the bar, but whenever I try a face wash, no matter how gentle and fragrance free and non comedogenic it is, I start breaking out.  
2) daily application of 1% clindamycin, 8% azelaic acid, and .25% zinc pyrithione.  I get it via Curology, but there are other ways of getting the individual ingredients.  I saw a HUGE improvement with my chin acne when we added the zinc especially.  
,1,1,0
Accutane! I've tried it all, from antibiotics, to anything they sell on commercials for acne, over the counter products, and natural masks. The only thing that got rid of it was Accutane. Has side effects of drying and i think im still experiencing dry lips 3 years later but anything to get rid of my cystic acne.,1,1,0
I went on birth control specifically for my acne and it made it far worse than it was when I started. I'm now going back on accutane to clear it all up! ,1,1,0
Spironolactone has completely cleared my cystic acne.. maybe look into that? I still have acne but no longer cystic hormonal acne! ,1,1,0
Dont touch or pop!,1,1,0
I can't tell you what kind of acne you have, you would need to visit a doctor for that.

There is evidence that glycemic load has an effect on acne. This is because of the effects that sugar has on the body's production of hormones. Because of this, it will take weeks of regularly eating an excess of carbs for diet to have any effect on your skin. Hormones are the slow effectors in our bodies.

If you've cut out sugar for the most part, then the issue isn't your diet. This is assuming you have cut out excess sugars for a long time, at least 3 months.

Moisturize regularly, use a gentle cleanser, use sun screen, and go to a derm. A doctor will be able to give you the best active acne meds, oral or topical, that will work for your particular skin type and acne.,3,3,0
Try exfoliating! There are two types of exfoliators:

1. chemical
2. mechanical (like a scrub)

I recommend either. And salicylic acid would really help lighten your scars and help reducing pimple inflammation (I recommend the Neutrogena brand!)

Most importantly, is to moisturize because your skin needs to repair and heal itself from all the exfoliators and acne spot treatments. Find a gentle one that doesn't have acne medication because that will just further irritate and dry your skin. My favorite is acne.org's moisturizer.

Also, check out the rating of your current skincare products with cosDNA (cosdna.com), you'd be surprised what products could have been irritating your skin the entire time.

Good luck!,3,3,0
Question: What liquids have you been drinking?,2,2,0
Okay...this is how it works. What you eat..will show up somewhere on and in your body. Question: What is your daily sugar intake (and be honest with yourself)...like: cookies, cakes, ice cream...etc. Eating this stuff could be the reason for all these facial pimples.,2,2,0
Diagnosed with PCOS, on hormonal birth control pills, taking over the counter vitamin A pills (not in excess, I'm aware of the damage they can cause), and over the counter zinc. 

Was using epiduo and antibiotics at the time the first picture was taken, my skin was too sensitive and I had to stop. It hurt to sleep. Finished the antibiotics tho.,8,8,0
Congratulations. I can imagine how u must've felt. I feel so self conscious whenever I have a breakout. I've had one for 3 months. Disappears then returns. Bad thing is it's not localized, it appears on different parts of my face.

Congratulations again!,2,2,0
It works--fantastically!! 
But it does take time. It took me four months to start seeing a noticeable difference, 6 months to really kick in.  I'm at 7 months now and 99 percent clear. It's a miracle. 
I had hormonal/ cystic acne on jawline. 
I tried everything natural and I mean everything. 
I will stay on this forever if I can. Minimal side effects and changed my life! 
,5,5,0
I've been on spiro for maybe 9 months now, and it's definitely reduced my chine and around mouth acne, I now rarely get pimples around my jawline. Though I don't have or have had cystic acne.,1,1,0
I didn't start seeing noticeable improvement until 2 months. Now at 4 and have plateaued, so the dermatologist is raising my dosage.,1,1,0
Yes. Love it. I'm on 100 as well. I'm bad for not taking my BC along with it though. I've not seen a difference with or without birth control to be completely honest with you.  That's the only dosage that has made a difference for me and this is the last ladder before accutane. It's not recommended to go more than that because of how potassium increases while on it.  I have to take a blood test probably every six months to just check that I'm not overdosing on potassium.  It takes about 2 months to see a difference or one month, if you're lucky.  You're basically dehydrating yourself taking this since it's a diuretic. So drink a lot of water.  Skin overall will continue the same just that your cystic acne would go from 5+ and decrease to prob 1 or 2 cystic bumps a month which would then help if you regularly see a dermatologist to get cortisone shots.  I stopped it for 2 months and all hell came lose so I've become dependent on it. ,1,1,0

aah!! why would you do that up to 4 times to your face!! someone correct me if I'm mistaken but isn't it like super toxic to wash your face that often? I mean, you probably should only wash your face once, in the evening, with cleanser (and tonic n stuff) and just water and moisturizer in the morning? 

dude, your acne isn't going to go away quicker cause you use so much stuff constantly. trust me, been there, done that, messed up my skin for a couple years, but it's okay now. besides that, your products are great!! keep it up man and don't loose your spark ,4,4,0
What do you wash your face with? I can recommend Cetaphil, it's non-comedogenic and really gentle on your face, which you'll need if you're using harsh products such as benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Also, if you're going to use benzoyl peroxide in the morning be sure to use sun cream.,3,3,0
After trying acne product after acne product, there's no way to tell what's best for your skin if you don't try it. Everybody's different. For example, some people consider BP cream holy grail, meanwhile it's ineffective for me. Just keep exploring different ingredients til you find the best one for you.

Also please don't wash your face more than 2 times a day.,2,2,0
DO NOT DO THIS 4 TIMES PER DAY. ,2,2,0
Wash 2 ( 3 if u have an oily skin like me) times a day by only throwing cold ( not very cold, just a bit ) water at your face and not scrubing the skin with ur hands.,1,1,0
I own all the products that you just listed, and used to be in your place like a few months ago, but this ended up over-irritating my skin and although initially over drying my skin from these products cleared my skin, it ended up getting used to the irritation and then started getting worse.


You're irritating your skin way too much. You need to stick to one of those treatments, not all 3. Also, make sure tea tree oil isn't making your acne worse, because it can either really help or hurt it (turns out my skin doesn't like it)

You need a moisturizer that doesn't have medication in it so you're skin can heal itself without feeling even more irritated from the previous treatments, or you can use the moisturizer you currently have and downsize the amount of acne treatment you apply a day (start off every other day, and then everyday, so your skin can get used to the product. AGAIN, IRRITATION IS PREVENTABLE IN THIS CASE, THIS IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU COULD MAKE IF YOU OVERDO IT just because you were too excited for results).

Good luck!,1,1,0
Most RX meds will give you an IB. It's up to you to decide if you'd rather live with your current situation or take the chance to fix it.

I'm glad I used my RX meds and after a few months of patience and consistent use, have gotten results and I don't have anywhere near the same number of active pimples and closed comedones that I had before.,1,1,0
I've had acne for 20+ years. I was having a severe outbreak when I decided to try Differin. Initially, it did irritate my skin. Little bit of stinging, little bit of itching. Lasted for about a week. It took a couple of weeks of nightly use to see results. It's been about 8 weeks and my skin is the clearest it's been since I was a child. I wash my face with a very moisturing cleanser and then I apply Differin. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes before applying moisturizer.  In the morning, I cleanse and moisture. Consistency and patience is the key. Hope it works for you. ,1,1,0
Try using it every 2-3 days at the beginning and gradually work your way up to every day. And moisturise with a gentle but effective lotion (I like the Cetaphil one). If you are flaky or irritated try an occlusive like Aquaphor or Vaseline at night before you go asleep, it feels slimy but makes so much difference!,1,1,0
üó£I-L-L! I also went to U of I and I lived in Champaign for my first job. I notice my acne gets worse when I change my environment, too. I spent last summer in Brazil and my skin got so bad. But when I came back to Chicago and back to my normal habits, my skin went back to normal. It could be a variety of factors: food, exercise, sleep. ,1,1,0
You can just get benzoyl peroxide topical from a pharmacy, it's almost the exact same thing, epiduo is just a lot more expensive for very similar results,2,2,0
Epiduo is adapalene 0.1% (Differin) and benzoyl peroxide 2.5%. Both can be purchased without a prescription. Use Differin at night and BP in the morning. Moisturize always and ensure you use sunscreen during the day. ,2,2,0
It will not look like that sfter washing your face because you have oily skin and it will make your face a little bit darker.....do wash your face when you feel its  in excess but dont do it all the time as its not good for skin even as it do need some oil.
I can say all of these from my own experience.,1,1,0
These are enlarged pores,2,2,0
I currently wash my face twice a day with Clinique acne face wash. In the morning I apply Clinique super defense. At night I apply Clinique moisture surge. My diet could be better but I highly doubt that will completely get rid of this as I've been eating greens like a herbivore for a while now and only recently have cut down on the greens i eat due to being lazy. I dont consume dairy and I cut out like 99% of added sugar from my diet. Diet is not really an issue and I feel as if diet has done all it's can for me as my acne was 20x worse several years ago before I decided to eat healthier. I get a few zits here and there but mostly my cheeks are the issue as I also have closed comedones on my upper left and right cheek. Any over the counter medication I could use to help with the huge pore appearance?  And are these huge "open pores" actually acne scars? ,1,1,0

Ehhh...in my opinion, drinking water as a cure for acne is a myth. I've spent most of my life drinking only water, and yet I still had cystic acne for almost a decade. 

I can kind of see it helping if a person switches from drinking a lot of soda/juice/milk/alcohol to drinking water. Cutting dairy and sugar is helpful for me. Water might be one way to do that.,1,1,0

I cut out coffee to reduce my acne, but for me I don't think it was the caffeine that was the problem. Dairy and sugars are triggers if you struggle with acne and that's what I put in my coffee everyday. It did help clear my face, but if you can find alternatives for creams and sugars I'd say try that first ,1,1,0

I think in general it can help with hydration issues. I have never cut it out for more than 2 weeks. Personally, I don't drink coffee when I know I am dehydrated or stressed. So for example, if I had a weekend of drinking (even just 2-3 drinks) I will choose tea the next couple of mornings. Its surprising how long it takes for my body to feel hydrated again.,1,1,0
Crying about that. I've noticed a decrease in my cystic acne and flare up go away faster than normal when I cut out coffee completely. I can't live without coffee so I rather spend like 20 for spiro.  I have insurance :p,1,1,0
You sure you haven't changed ANYTHING in your diet? Be specific. Forehead is usually diet related. Maybe your body grew and intolerance to something out of nowhere. This is cliche but try cutting out dairy for a little bit just to see what ur body does? (If ur vegan then maybe cut down on the sugars you eat and up your protein intake)

Literally the exact same thing happened to me!! 20/f here, had occasional spots in high school, but overall never bad acne, and then all of a sudden huge breakouts! It's super embarrassing because everyone else is growing out their acne, but mine's only getting worse :( Any other thoughts on causes? I did move to a new apartment around this same time, but if that's the issue, what about the apartment could be causing this? I can't exactly move apartments to help acne so any tips would be great!,1,1,0
Hi, I am a 30 year old female and had a similar experience, my skin fluctuates between extremely oily to dry and lifeless. I broke out recently (over a month ago) all over the lower half of my face, especially my jawline with painful and cystic acne. I set up an appointment with a dermatologist but thought will try out a few things beforehand and the below worked for me.
Cystic acne at our age is almost always hormonal, either your body is not flushing out toxins as it should or your hormones are not regulated. I joined yoga last month and observed that adding a bit of an exercise routine helped the clearing process, I still have cystic acne but they're far less painful and smaller than they were a month back. As against 15-20 zits just a month before, I now have only 4 or 5. I also increased my fluid intake and cut down all diary except low fat yogurt and completely removed processed sugar from my diet (sugar from fruits and honey is okay in moderation). Reduced carb intake, This includes starchy food like bread, pizza etc.

I follow a bit of Ayurveda (ancient Indian preventive medicine), I'm drinking a concoction made of fennel, cumin and coriander seeds, I just boil a spoon of all these in two cups of water, add honey, dilute it with a bottle of water and drink it throughout the day. This has helped reduce inflammation and helped my acne to heal faster. I've also stopped drinking packaged juices and replaced it with fresh fruits.
Here's my skin care routine that's working really well so far *touchwood*

Morning: 
Face wash: SK II treatment cleanser
Toner: Thayers witch hazel toner
Moisturizer: Dr. Jart ceramidin liquid (This is a game changer)
Acne spot treatment: Skinceuticals blemish+age serum (look for online websites that sell samples)

Night:
Face wash: SK II treatment cleanser
Toner: Thayers witch hazel toner
Moisturizer: Sunday Riley Juno face oil, this oil is helping in fading a lot of the post acne scars without breaking me out further.
Acne spot treatment: Skinceuticals blemish+age serum, this serum dries up the acne really well and the Juno oil helps relieve the dryness this serum causes.

Makeup: Estee lauder foundation/ Amore Pacific BB cushion

Hey there, I can't really offer much advice with this, except my skin definitely does extremes and seems to go in cycles of getting and then better then bad again. I was just wondering how well you think differin works? I got prescribed it today but it's bloody expensive and wanted some insight before I buy!,2,2,0
Use moisturizer after every application of benzoyl peroxide to prevent drying. Vanicream (comes in a big pump bottle at most drug stores in the US) works very well.

Also try reducing frequency of BP application at first and then building up tolerance. If these measures don't work you should try a different treatment option.,4,4,0
It takes time for your skin to get used to it. Give it a week or two and moisturize whenever you can. Give your skin a break and don't apply the treatment for one or two days.  ,3,3,0
I used to have this problem too especially in the winter time and my skin would get really dry and it would be extremely difficult to apply makeup without it flaking up. 

I wouldn't scrub so hard and so vigorously if you're doing it like that but I would still exfoliate your skin but gently. Depending on how hard you're scrubbing your face that could be the reason you have more spots than before 

Like another comment  said -moisturize!! Find one that works for you and use that shit lol I know it's terrible but I used to not moisturize my skin unless I wore makeup because moisturizer seemed to break me out ! But i finally found one that works for my combo acne prone skin and it does help 

Use a mask maybe and again, exfoliate every couple of days or every other day. Keep trying things and changing things around until you find what works for you

And I know u probably already know this but drink a lot of water!

Best of luck :) ,2,2,0
Good advice in this thread. OP, you should give your skin a break for 1-2 days. BP, even at 2.5% can be quite drying and irritating. Moisturize 2x/day. And don't forget the sunblock, even if you're only outside for a few minutes. ,1,1,0
Dude. If your skin is cracking-- decrease the dosage. Your skin is going to try to send a good load of sebum to the surface which if your skin sloughs off irregularly (like me üòë) is just waiting to get clogged. The skin has this mechanism in place so give your skin some rest. Moisturize, make sure you have no products that contain alcohol. TBH 2.5% is mild af. You can afford to skip prob like 3 days. ,1,1,0
Definitely looks like closed comedones. I have the same thing and I use BHA and AHA. I've definitely noticed a decrease in new comedones.,1,1,0
To me it doesn't look like she has many new breakouts, but a lot of scarring. 

IMO her best option is Fractional CO2 laser, however, this is kinda pricey (~$500 per treatment) and involves some recovery time. 

Other option: Some sort of topical cream/gel. It can take a long time (if ever) to see good results from these. Bio-Oil, Retin-A, or snail gel could work.,14,14,0
Facial oils!!!! These are a God send when it comes to scarring! Almond oil, rosehip oil, jojoba oil! 

I have very bad cystic acne, the kind that leaves deep discolored scars. But since I am an AVID facial oils gal, you would never tell that I suffer from severe acne! I mix jojoba oil in with my moisturizer every night and it seriously speeds up the healing time! Go look them up on Amazon! The one I use has a rating o 4.8 stars and over 6000+ positive reviews,7,7,0
Look into dermarolling.,5,5,0
Some of the best treatments I've found were to be TCA cross and saline injections for rolling and ice-pick scarring. Acne.org has some great forums on both. TCA cross involves placing high concentrations of TCA peel into ice-pick scars to help build collagen. Saline injections involve a thin, 30 gage diabetic syringe filled with sterile saline to be injected into the depression, over time it helps elevate the dent (rolling scars). 
Unfortunately, both methods take time in between and multiple treatments. I live in a rural part of Pennsylvania and these options aren't available to me via a dermatologist. I've done them myself, and honestly it's worked. It's just tedious. From what I've read, saline injections can take +6 treatments to see results with 6 weeks downtime in between. But I've seen improvements in the atrophy dents from cortisone shots with at least three treatments.
The TCA cross has caused red hyperpigmentation, but I've had a couple rounds of laser genesis afterwards which has improved it. Overall, this is my experience. Please see a dermatologist to get recommendations but my suggestions are something to consider. Good luck.,4,4,0
Look into treatments like PRP and dermaroling, they're safer, cheaper and have short downtimes as compared to lasers. And the % of improvement is also good.,2,2,0
It looks like a lot of this is scarring. She can try using some vitamin C products to help reduce the hyper pigmentation, or if she wants something stronger she should go for some retinoids. Don't mix the two I just mentioned btw. Before starting either, make sure you do proper research on amounts that would be good for you, or visit a derm. Since the scars are deep, she could also go to a derm to get laser treatments done. ,2,2,0

Med student here (take advice with many grains of salt). That theory is not backed by science, and I wouldn't recommend it. You will probably experience worse breakouts as your pores become more clogged. Accutane has a relapse rate of anywhere from 20-60%, depending on the study, with worse response rates for women with hormonal acne and patients with acne involving their trunk. It is, however, the most efficacious treatment for non-hormonal, severe cystic acne; if you don't think the side effect profile is worth it, then that is your decision!  But accutane is candy to dermatologists, so you will likely be told about it again should you seek a 2nd opinion. 

Disclaimer: my sister and husband have both been on accutane with superb results, so I am probably biased about its efficacy. ,1,1,0
UPDATE:

I've been doing this for 3 days and my face actually feels more clean that not, and all inflammation is gone. So far everything else is the same, but I think I'm gonna keep doing this because this is definitely more of a result than any product I've been using. ,1,1,0
Accutane has a 90% success rate actually, and in 60% of people it doesn't come back at all. That 40% it likely doesn't come back as severe as it was before. ,1,1,0
No. Do not put lemon juice on your face. Use a vitamin c serum. Lemon juice may cause chemical burns on your face ,4,4,0

Med student here--off the record (no idea what the dermatologists' line on this is), I noticed a HUGE improvement in my acne when I switched from tret 1x per day to tret every other day. It might be totally anecdotal, but there ya go. 

*Edit: You should use a pea-size amount of tret for your entire face--no more. If your skin is dry and crackly, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer. Be sure to give any topical you put on your face (including moisturizers) a full 15 min to soak in before applying anything else. ,1,1,0
No one here can tell whether what you're experiencing are chemical burns or not. I suggest going to a dermatologist to rule out any other conditions and to get a correct assessment of your skin.,1,1,0
I‚Äôve experienced this too. Recently tried the acne defense set from Human Nature, facial wash, toner and gel. I‚Äôve noticed the burning semsation every time I apply the toner (after using the facial wash). It intensifies when I apply the gel. At first, it was bearable but after a week and a half if continuous usage, I noticed redness around my mouth and nose. These are the areas that burns when I use the acne defense products. I suggest you stop using all the products you mentioned and consult a dermatologist. Though in my case, the redness starts to fade when I switch back on my old cleansing routine sans the acne defense set.,1,1,0

It's not necessarily for acne but I swear by it. The silicone scrubber is effective and soft and doesn't scratch the skin. The cleanser is a gosh-send.

Yes, the issue is that for everyone there is a different solution. And if you take all of them and combine, then you will have a contradictions. There is more then one type of acne and more then one type of skin. So first find out what is your types and then take it to consideration when reading these "tips". 

And if you start using some medication please read the leaflet. I'm always furious when I see people mentioning benzyl peroxide and sun exposure and then wonder why is not working :D,9,9,0

If you are reading the posts/threads expecting a silver bullet, well then you are bound to think all of it is "B.S". Everybody's skin is different and each one of this has helped someone to fix their problems.   

So the trick here is adjusting YOUR attitude to one where you are gathering information to make a choice/decision as to what is right for YOU. ,3,3,0
Sadly you have to do your research and find what works for you. 

Fish oils for me make my inflammation worse so I don't take them anymore. 

Did the whole probiotics thing and it work great at first but then it started to get bad. Turns out once you balance your gut flora, taking more probiotics starts to throw it off balance. 

For me the best results vitamin wise has been Centrum women's multi vitamin. If I forget to take it for even a day I notice. 

Also I do a regime from Image skin care recommended by my facialist and it has done wonders, but it's trial and error for sure. ,2,2,0
Yeah, you have to find what works for you. The most boy things that I think on that list are universal are wash your bedclothes regularly and take vitamin e and zinc. I'd add vitamin A to that too.

I find stopping using cleansers apart from very rarely helped me loads. I think I was over cleansing my face. I now use water, even to remove my makeup, and a microfiber cloth. Then I use various chemicals to help with hyperpigmentation and stuff - glycolic acid mainly. 

Acne is a struggle, and everyone is different. ,2,2,0
 OP nailed it when they acknowledged everyone's skin is different, and like u/whatacoinkidinki said, there's different acne too! I can totally understand how frustrating the process is (BEEN THERE DONE THAT M8) but unfortunately just reading about what others do and then thinking it's going to be a miracle cure is the wrong way to take this sub. This sub is a collection of everyone's experiences that will give you an *idea* of what to try, as opposed to being a straight cure for everyone. ACNE IS ANNOYING AND THE WORST üò≠üò≠ AND WHAT SUCKS IS THAT YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO TRY EVERYTHING TO FIND WHAT WORKS FOR YOU. So, what I would do is change the way you view this sub and your approach to acne! Look at this as potential ideas of things you can try, to see if they work for you. But it's a process and you can't avoid the process by lurking on this subreddit. I really do wish you the best of luck with your skincare journey!! I hope you can find what works for your skin asap!

I think this is a great post! IMO the advice you find on subs like this one is (in general) useless. As you point out - it's mostly anecdotes and pseudoscience. And people don't seem to understand that! Just look at this thread. People are still chiming in with their advice despite the subject of this post. It's almost comical. I get that people want to help others if they have found something they think has helped them, but you have to understand that your own personal experience has very little value for others.

Ance is a reaction, much like a rash. In the right environment anyone can have a breakout. Environment is synonymous for many things down to the air we breath, food we eat, hormones, genetics etc..Not everyone is affected equally by these things and because we are all different there is a million different combinations as to what can cause a breakout for an individual. Not only that, but bodies change over time so what may have caused a breakout may not cause one later in life and vice versa. ,1,1,0
-fish oil is great for your brain, take this.

-Take vitamin A, take 1 everyday.(Accutane on steroids)

-wash your pillow case regularly.

TBH you have really good skin. I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking at.

I'm 20, I only have moderate acne in middle school and high school, mostly just in my t-zone. Now, my skin is normally combination/a little oily but generally very soft and smooth with a few blemishes here and there. Out of no where, a few days ago, my entire face broke out. It's now red and patchy, scaley, dry and itches. Especially on my chin, upper lip, under eye/side of nose. I usually use clean and clear morning burst as a daily wash, and just switched to the generic but the ingredients are exactly the same, that's the only thing I've changed recently. It's not as severe as a lot of other faces on this sub but it's a major change for me and the redness and itching is embarrassing and annoying. I have trouble sleeping because it's so itchy but I don't want to scratch it and break the skin. I used benzoyl peroxide a few times and it didn't make it better or worse. I don't know if this is acne or an allergic reaction, and if it's a reaction I don't know what against. I just recently went back to college so maybe it's a stress thing, but I'm no more stressed than usual and I've never had this before. The only time I had anything like this was last winter I got fifth disease, I got really bad cold and flu like symptoms along with a facial rash around my mouth. But I haven't had any other symptoms.

My advice is stick with retinoids for a year and see if that helps. For your case, I'd probably ask for Tazorac/Fabior. Probably the strongest of the retinoids. It takes time. My forehead acne was bad, not as bad as yours. I started on adapalene, one of the actives in Epiduo, and now is OTC. It did nothing. I was switched to Renova which felt like smearing mayo on my face and did next to nothing. Retin A worked decently but dried my skin to the point of pain. I found my perfect retinoid with RetinA micro 0.04%. The micro means it has little sponge like things in the formulation to release the active over time, making it more effective and less dramatic on your skin. 

I tried clindamycin gel too and I didn't think it helped. I also tried both of the main tetracyclines and amox and nothing. 

It sucks now and I thought my face would look like that, but almost a year of trying new retinoids and finding the right one, my acne is gone, scarring is gone, and my skin is amazing. It's a hard battle and it will take some time, but stick to it. Also, find a better derm. Epiduo sucks. Ask to get Retin-A micro 0.08% samples and give it a shot.,1,1,0
 I had inflamed back acne. I was on accutane for nine months. This is my experience.

Pros: my back was clear at the end of nine months.

Cons: Roughly first two months felt like regoing through puberty.
I had to get my blood drawn once a month.
My lips were bone dry.
Can't drink alcohol at all. It can harm the liver.

The Derm maybe took me off too early, my face broke out several months after getting off accutane.

I didn't want to get back on accutane and I found a different solution: 

-Take vitamin A, take 1 everyday.(Accutane on steroids)

-Take asadopholis complex, one.(bacteria that helps with digestion)

-Drink copious amounts of only water, Ditch soda, sugar and junk food if possible.

-wash your pillow case regularly.

Accutane is the only thing that has actually completely eradicated my acne.

Omg we are in the exact same situation. I have been using it since June 2015 and at the time my acne was mostly pimples and white heads. Now, after using retin a religiously as well as clindamycin I have deep cystic acne all around my chin and jaw. I don't know if the retin a is the culprit for continuous breakouts, because I am far past the purging stage. But at this point I'm too scared to stop using it without talking to a dermatologist first. I've pretty much determined it's hormonal bc of the pattern I described above and have a dermatology appt jn 2 weeks to finally figure out this ish. 

As far as moisturizing, I do have a recommendation! It's the ONLY moisturizer that works well w the dry skin from the retin a and doesn't make me break out. And it's cheap too! Drugstore status lol. It's clean and clear dual action, it has salicylic acid in it so it helps with surface acne but also moisturizers but doesn't contribute to any oiliness for me. Seriously a lifesaver. ,1,1,0
Have you tried non comedogenic moisturizers? Your skin must be really dry.

Stress can affect your hormone levels and your skin. I had perfect skin until a really stressful time in my life blew my face up.

Wow... Retin-A never gave me the positive results that you got at first. I have sensitive skin and instantly my face reddened, cracked, and dried out. Also, I received intense burns after about an hour in the sun! After that, I stayed away from prescription drugs.

I have fair skin and I would consider my skin sensitive. I have used Retin A 0.05% for years and it has served me quite well. The key to using it is not to put it on heavy but very lightly. When first using the product, limit usage to three nights per week until your skin becomes acclimated to it. Then it can be used each night. If it is still too strong for your skin, mix it with a little moisturizer. A tube of Retin A should last at least three months if used lightly. Sunscreen is a must when outside.

It's actually not that severe definitely in the moderate category as far as acne goes. Those look like they will turn to whiteheads pretty soon. Make sure you have a solid routine going starting with a gentle water based face wash, then using an active such as Benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid and then finish it off with a moisturizer (important even if you have oily skin). If you wear makeup, try a cleansing balm or micellar water to get it off before you cleanse. In the mornings I also recommend sunscreen as your last step. It isn't just for super sunny days. ,3,3,0

Its not severe. 

Get some benzoyl peroxide (neutrogena maximum strength) spot gel and just use a natural face wAsh. Dont believe all the people who say use moisturizers and oils. Its makes it worse.  Try to get aface wash with no frangrance or dyes. Burts bees sensitive face wash works well. If any scars use neosporin at night.,1,1,0

My light brown hair has two streaks of blonde from Stridex pads. I think it frames my face nicely so I don't mind!,3,3,0
I mean benzoyl peroxide is.. you know... bleach essentially. If you don't want it do any more hair coloring I recommend you get one of those towel like headbands you put on before you wash your face and stuff it should protect your hairline. I dunno if you're joking or not on the spread it in your hair part, but boi it's gonna dry out your scalp a lot. Dandruff is never fun,1,1,0
Stay strong and positive buddy, what you said about seeing others with acne and not thinking it's bad is just the same for you! At school sometimes  it is difficult to think that people make judgements on character rather than appearance, but things do get better! surround yourself with supportive people and those who know you for more than just what's on the outside. When friends look at you they aren't looking at your spots, they see your laugh, smile, personality and stories - don't let acne dictate how you live your life

And if you believe there are people who do judge you on these superficial factors, they are certainly not worth your time in the long run - fuck em! 

I know this may not give you much solace as when you perceive your skin in this way it's hard to concentrate on anything else. However, try not to let it affect your experience and enjoyment of your school years, if anything these tough times will have built your personality, bringing you humility and respect for those in similar situations in the future

One key thing that can cause acne is hormones and you can't really change those too much. If you're really worried I recommend going to a derm and they can prescribe you something whether it be topical or oral. ,3,3,0
Just go to a dermatologist. They will help you figure out what's causing your acne and give you prescriptions that will clear you up! I struggled with acne for years and tried to treat it naturally with no luck. When I finally decided to go to a derm I was completely clear in a few months! I still get breakouts occasionally but now I just go back to my derm and he helps me figure out how to change my treatment and fight the acne. Good luck!!,3,3,0

She probably will, my parents had horrible acne, my brother does, and I got a mild case. I would suggest instilling good practices to prevent it, and figuring out what her dietary triggers are. It's the worst :(,2,2,0
My experience is that I had blackheads on my nose when I was in 5th grade (around 11 y/o I think) and I had pretty rough acne throughout middle school. I finally went to the dermatologist and we decided to go on different cremes, medicines, and antibiotics. It helped a good amount, but then everything just stopped working. I'm going on isotretinoin this week. My dad still struggles with acne, and he went on isotretinoin in the 1970s when they didn't know all about the side effects. My mom never had any acne, or any of her family. I definitely think hereditary acne is worse and takes longer to beat (might not be officially true but it's just what I've noticed). Hormonal acne is the type almost everyone gets, hereditary acne is longer and harder. Maybe if you're concerned talk to your family that has had the acne, or her pediatrician, or if it gets worse maybe find a dermatologist.,2,2,0
It's not guaranteed, but she will probably have some skin issues in her lifetime. I say you get her started on a very light skincare routine just to start some good habits. All you need is a super gentle cleanser and a moisturizer since she might be a little you for stuff like benzoyl peroxide ,1,1,0
My Dr told my mom when I had white spots on my nose that it was a sign I'd have a period sooner or later. To the person suggesting look into your diet, I'm here to tell you my fate. No one else in my family really has acne, I had it bad. Like I'm almost 30 and it's still horrid. I've tried about every med, nothing worked. For other reasons I decided dairy wasn't working for me, so I went dairy free. 

I started dating a guy and ate a ton of dairy, my skin looks like I'm 13 again. I decided enough is enough and in 4 days my acne is drying up and going away, no new lesions!!! I wish more doctors would look into our bodies holistically. There is a reason why things happen

I underwent cyst removal surgery at the age of 10 for a large cyst on the middle of my left cheek. I had over 20 stitches and had to wear a bandaid over my entire cheek for a month. Im 16 now and my acne has covered up the scar completely. Not sure if that is a bad or good thing :|,1,1,0
I'm in a super similar situation. I've been on birth control for 3 months and my acne got much worse so my dermatologist put me on spironolactone. I've been on spironolactone for a month and a half and even though I don't have oily skin but the acne has gotten again worse.

My dermatologist is making me switch my birth control and has given me the option to start accutane in October. This automatically makes me think that my acne is not hormonal even though it is located on my cheeks.

Are you experiencing side effects from spironolactone?
Do you find that you are still have cystic breakouts?,1,1,0
Stick it out with the spiro. It takes most people longer to see results, it took me 5 months. Unfortunately it stopped working after 4 years though. 

I've been on accutane too and that worked great but if your acne is hormonal, there's a good chance it will come back. Once I got my new IUD, it all came back.,1,1,0
Stay with spiro if u arent experiencing side effects 100%. Get off of Doxy. Not worth exposing your body to antibiotics for a long period of time. Itll unbalance your gut flora and end up making shit worse. ,1,1,0
I take 50mg of spironolactone and also am on a birth control pill I have hormonal cystic acne after around three months of spiro I saw a huge difference in the cystic acne any improvement after that was really gradual and hardly noticeable till I looked at old photos.. but recently it's been sooo humid here and I started breaking out a lot but not cystic or hormonal acne just black head small white heads then I upped my spiro to 100mg and It's only been four days but I had a cystic pimple pop up super bummed but I'm hoping it will go away.. try looking into vitamins like fish oil or vitamins A also there is a YouTube girl named organic Olivia and she gives a list of things that worked magic for her hormonal acne and one of the vitamins she recommended was L-lysine 1000mg I bought it from Amazon haven't started yet but the reviews are great! Maybe worth checking out ,1,1,0
There's a bunch of stuff you can try, but honestly I would get accutane. I had similarly severe cystic acne all throughout my teenage years (and still have some, albeit not as bad now) and tried everything else as I was afraid of it and now I'm in my 20s with a face full of scars and still have acne.

Maybe try a diet change, some people have success with keto/low carb.,2,2,0

This is a conversation to have between yourself and trained medical professionals. That sucks you had shitty interaction with your dermatologist. Reddit is not the place to seek advice about the drug interactions of your medical case. The best you can hope for here is well intentioned vague advice and the worst is dangerous ignorance that, because of the forum, cannot understand the specifics of your situation.

Schedule an appointment with your GP and go to that appointment with a written list of your concerns and questions that you tick off as they are addressed. Writing down everything you want to ask is the best way to insure your concerns are addressed and that you don't forget anything. Written lists also help you focus through the anxiety that a doctor's appointment causes.

Most people will tell you a good combination of sunscreen during the day, a good moisturizer, and vitamin C (serum, or moisturizer) during the day,along with glycolic acid peel (or other AHA or BHA) will go a long way for you. I personally find that applying ice daily makes the redness go down, although this is purely ancedotal and not really a accepted way of reducing pigmentation. Other than that, if you are older and have the money, there a variety of laser resurfacing and peels you could do to help. Get a good skin routine and stick to it, and they you should see progress in weeks or a couple months.,6,6,0

Stop using proactive. 

Get a 99.9 natural face wash with no fragrance or dyes. 
Use a spot gel 
Stay away from salicylic acid if you stop using it it makes the acne come back worse ( i have experienced this) 
Benzoyl peroxide is better (neutrogena maximum strength)

Burts bees makes great natural face washes 
Stay away from moisturizers. 
If you have acne it makes it worse.  
Use neosporin for scars. 
Just try to use very little things on your face.

I recently just upped mine from 50 to 100 as well! It's only been maybe four days but I lost around 30 pounds just getting on it originally and now I'm actually under weight.. I'd loooove my boobs to grow haha I also workout 3-4 times a week and eat generally healthy Aka organic low sugar low grain and minimal red meat. Is it common for people to gain weight on spiro? ,1,1,0
Yeah thirty pounds is a crazy amount i don't think it was solely do to spiro but a lot of the water weight and bloat definitely is from spiro. I feel like I really am but idk if it's just the break out that I was seeing before that made me want to increase or if it's from increasing but since I have it hasn't gotten better and I've just been breaking out a lot worse.. it could also be this horrible muggy heat I've been experiencing this past week! Has yours improved or gotten worse? I read spiro shouldn't have a purging state and I can remember how it was when I first started taking it ,1,1,0

For me without birth control I won't even have a cycle and even on the pill it's super irregular! I'm not the typical candidate for pcos based on my doctors standards.. but I have had a pelvic ultra sound that came up with small cyst/fibroids she argued that I didn't have it because I'm not over weight but I  work HARD and workout to not be.. I have male pattern hair growth and I was told if I wanted to have kids when the day comes I should do a fertility test because most likely I won't be able to naturally.. but like you I hadn't been diagnosed but recently I got my doctor to agree to doing blood work and I really hope i can get this all figured out because hormone imbalances are no joke! Both my sisters have pcos I wouldn't want to take birth control but my body goes completely wacko if I'm not taking it ,1,1,0

Have you been to a dermatologist yet?,2,2,0
Hi! I just want to say first of all, 'still' having acne at 24 is normal. It's a lie that acne disappears when you're no longer a teenager! So brush that off and think positive about trying to fix it :) 

I do have to tell you what you DON'T want to hear, and that's that no one here can tell you what kind of acne you have. Your best bet, like the first comment says, is to see a dermatologist and have them diagnose your acne. The problem is everyone's acne can be different and what works for me might not work for you. 

However, I noticed you're trying acidic things like sodium bicarbonate to fix your acne, and that the Clinique products contain further acids (the salicylic acid) but acne can also be caused by overusing these products! Your skin sounds so thirsty!! The signs of flaking skin all scream that your skin barrier is damaged from using all of these harsh products! My recommendation to you is to watch this video from Lisa Yu https://youtu.be/2jUFYF9SiCI about how to fix your skin barrier. 

Once your skin barrier heals and becomes hydrated, hopefully your acne will subside, and you can introduce LITTLE BY LITTLE some actives into your routine. But that bicarbonate/tomato thing does not sound good so definitely stop doing that and instead invest in some moisturising toner, essence, and gel or cream moisturiser to first of all fix your skin barrier. I'm actually in the process of almost fixing mine from going nuts on acids, and then from never properly moisturising because I thought that's what was causing my acne BUT I WAS A GODDAMN FOOOOOL! 

TL;DR See a dermatologist for a diagnosis. Your skin barrier sounds like it needs to be repaired, so invest in good moisturising products, and stop putting acids/actives on your poor skin. Good luck on your skin care journey and I hope this has been helpful!,2,2,0
I would stay away from Clinique! If you're having dandruff on your face, I would use a more gentle exfoliant and minimize your baking soda usage! In some cases it's helpful but there's much more effective products that don't cause the bad side effects that can sometimes follow baking soda use. I use Cerave SA Lotion and it has made the biggest difference in my face (and body). I usually get tons of flankiness and dry skin off and on. This lotion helps keep it all at bay and does a ton for my clogged pores. It makes my skin so soft. 
You will see a awesome improvement after just a couple uses! 

Side note. My profile says I'm a male (idk why it did that automatically) but I'm actually a girl and I've been dealing with skin issues for years on years! This is a product I will use forever! ,1,1,0

Do you have oily or dry skin? Those are the types that get acne; don't feel hopeless, I've been where you are and Paula's has saved me.
These are NOT miracle products, but they WORK with daily consistency, morning and night
I have oily skin, and I use her face wash for oily skin, a light toner, salicilic acid for acne, a serum, benzoyl peroxide, then moisture plus sunscreen for daily use and at night just moisture 
Good luck!,1,1,0
28yo female here with very similar acne! So sorry you're dealing with it. I too tried to figure out what the problem was, but couldn't get any changes in my skin despite topical, dietary and lifestyles changes. The neck & jawline can be a big indicator of hormone imbalance, or infection (think lymph nodes all up in that area)
I do have hypothyroidism, but that's been around way longer than my acne, this round. I'm not big on antibiotics unless they're absolutely necessary, but I finally caved and it's honestly helped. Only 1 month in, but can already see a difference. Definitely go see your doctor, it's not worth suffering with, especially as a guy... I can't imagine shaving with such sensitive skin! Good luck!,1,1,0
I use the dr. Bronners tea tree oil liquid soap and a salux washcloth (you can get them 3 for $10 on amazon) and it totally cleared up 99% of my back and chest breakouts! I also wash/condition my hair in the beginning of showering and then clip it up the rest of the time. ,3,3,0

I was on accutane for 6 months, then was off of it for about another 6 months, and then i went back on for a second round for only 3 months. The dryness is unreal. Dry skin and dry lips. I hope you don't bite your lips like I do, because being a lip biter and having these dry accutane lips doesn't mix well. I would bite them all the time and they would be so bloody and patchy, it would even take some
of the skin around my lips off. Just use vaseline shea butter lip therapy, works wonders! or aquaphor. carry moisturizer around with you, because your skin will always, always be dry. also drink lots of water! another tip: don't get discouraged when the acne gets much, much worse during the peak. you'll want to cry everyday because it's so bad, but it's so worth it. after that point the acne just starts disappearing and you're left with flawless skin. it's truly an amazing feeling, I can't wait for you to experience it! good luck!,1,1,0

I used it for years and honestly I didn't notice a difference at all from just regular Benzoyl peroxide. ,2,2,0
And how long does it take to work , I have been on it for more on a week,1,1,0
When applying: moisturize first, wait until your skin has absorbed the moisturizer (usually takes about 1 hour for me but I use a lot) and then apply the epiduo (I normally use more than the recommended pea size amount, I normally use about 2-3 but epiduo can dry your skin out a lot when you start using it so start with a pea's worth for the first couple of weeks and when your skin's got used to it you can use more. Don't use too much though, it often works better if you use less. 

I've been using it for about 5 weeks and there is a nice improvement in my skin (less red, less spots forming and scars are fading)


If you use too much your skin will burn from the benzoyl peroxide, if this happens stop using it until your the burn has gone. 

If the epiduo is drying your skin out lots (flaky skin) then you can skip using it for a night or two and just moisturize instead and use it again when your skin is less dry.

If it isn't making your skin dry and/or when you've been using it for a couple of weeks and you've passed the stage where it dries your skin out a lot, try to use it every night and don't give up. It took me about a month until I saw an improvement so stick with it. ,1,1,0
I will try ur way thank you,1,1,0
I used to wash my face with a very gentle cleanser and then after drying, i would apply small amount of epiduo, wait for half hour and then wash it off and then apply a moisturizer if it felt dry. ,1,1,0
It takes time to work, but as a person who has struggled with acne for years, into adulthood, this is what has finally WORKED for me. Woo!

I started using it last November. I was discouraged when the derm prescribed it, thinking it was just another cream that would fail. 

My advice is to track your progress to help you see that it's working-it takes a while but (if your skin reacts to it like mine did, everyone is different) it will be very satisfying to look back and see progress. There is a free app for epiduo that stores photos for you and shows progress time lapses. 

Also, get a good moisturizer. I use cerave face cream. I wash my face before bed, apply epiduo.  Just a little bit! Smaller than a pea. Wash your hands as it can bleach fabrics. Let it dry before putting on clothes/getting into bed. No moisturizer at night, except maybe on skin around the eyes. 

In the AM, apply moisturizer. No epiduo or other acne things. 

Sometimes your skin will get super dry, especially when you start using it. I have found that when this happens, applying some moisturizer to my skin on the spots that are dry, then applying the epiduo over it helps. Or skip epiduo for a night and just liberally apply moisturizer. I would only skip 1 night though-it seems like epiduo works best when used consistently. 

Finally, don't be discouraged if it gets worse before it gets better. My dermatologist told me that this happens as the cream begins to work. It took about 3 months before I would say my skin looked blemish free. Since then though, I have had very few outbreaks and my overall skin tone and redness have greatly improved. 

Good luck! Be patient and I hope this product works as well for you as it has for me. ,1,1,0
I just hope this epiduo works . Thanks anyway I might get that moisturizer I  a boy btw üòõüòõ,1,1,0

I found that Cerave in the tub moisturized my skin the best while I was on accutane. Some nights I would seal it in with a thin layer of Aquaphor afterwards. Speaking of which, definitely invest in some Aquaphor. While I did have dry skin throughout my course, it could barely compare to how dry my lips were. Aquaphor was the only thing that soothed them (and even that was just a temporary fix)! As for sunscreen, I love the Japanese Biore UV Aqua rich. It's affordable, sinks into the skin nicely, and doesn't leave a white cast.. all while being SPF 50.

I spent sooo much money trying things but I'm better off with the topicals from the derm. They seem costly up front, but they last way longer and the cost on the back end ends up being cheaper. The derm's office can also do extractions as part of the visit and occasionally the doc will "prescribe" a light chemical peel as part of your treatment so that insurance will cover it if they think it will help. ,3,3,0

Chin, jawline & neck are usually pretty good indicators of hormone imbalance or infection (usually nothing serious). It may be worth talking to a doctor about it, and getting an antibiotic, especially before the military where you may not want to cut back on healthy carbs (I'm just thinking for boot camp or whatnot), and the potential for your skincare routine to be thrown out the window.

Pixi glow tonic has glycolic acid which supposedly helps with scars. I'm using that now. Although the improvement is slow, I do see the difference over a couple of months.

Can you explain why shaving every day makes a difference?
When I shave my face I'm basically asking to be covered in acne.,1,1,0
Absolutely not, buddy.

I had severe cystic acne from the start of high school until a couple of years ago (23 now). I was anti social and didn't go out much... I regret it completely. At least I found out how to cure it now :D

I didn't realize how many people accepted me for who I was until I left high school, and I missed out on a ton of fun experiences and potential long lasting friendships. 

People will talk if it's really bad, but MOST people don't care. There will, however, likely be a few bad apples who talk crap about everyone, but don't let those people bring you down. 

Be confident, have fun, and don't let anyone bring you down. ,7,7,0
Try your best to not let your acne get the best of you. I used to feel the same way back in high school. Unfortunately I did let my acne get the best of me and because of it, I only made a few friends. Just show your confidence and they won't think twice about your complexion. It's normal to have acne. I wish i could go back and re-do my high school years..,4,4,0
If they can't get to know you, and its because of acne, then fuck 'em. They're not the kind of friends you want or need. Secrets I wish I'd have learned much earlier in life. The subtle art of not giving a fuck. Be confident, do your job the best you can and talk to people you want to. If you discover they arent worth your time, energy or effort - fuck 'am and move on.,6,6,0
im in high school and no one isnt gonna not be your friend because of acne, just be as confident about it as possible ,2,2,0
I'm using the 10% and I like it, however it can be kind of drying so be careful!,2,2,0
Okay dude, all these face masks and oils and creams companies try to sell you are bullshit. Go to a dermatologist and get prescribed a prescription grade cream or maybe Accutane. ,2,2,0

I haven't had any problems with vegan protein. I use hemp protein or pea protein. Usually the powders you buy come with a mix. In fact there are some vegan protein powders out there that have a really great protein:carb:sugar ratio so that helps a lot with skin too. Less sugar, less problems Ive noticed. But yea dairy I would say stay away from for SURE. ,2,2,0
Wow how are these things so costly there..here it costs about 3 dollars for a tube which lasts for 3 months, lol. ,2,2,0
I finished a 6 month cycle about 8 months ago. After i finished i was so happy with the results and could not believe my luck. I didn't have any spots for around 6 months after finishing but they are now starting to return. Im going to wait a couple of months and re-assess wether to start taking it again.

The results are good but i guess they don't always last and it sucks while you are taking them.,2,2,0
Like DJ, my acne also came back, although it came back within the first month of stopping treatment (6 month cycle as well). 

Not sure of the stats, but I notice a lot of people get it back.

It's worth a try, but IMO, if I could go back, I wouldn't take accutane. Not worth the immediate side effects, nor the long term (I LOST MY ABILITY TO TAN WELL). I forgot sunscreen one day after my cycle and got absolutely toasted, second degree sunburn with boils all over the exposed areas. 

Totally not worth it for me. ,2,2,0
I think it depends most on what kind of acne you have to begin with. if you are female with primarily hormonal acne, chances are it will come back at least a bit. it seems like men have this problem a lot less. ,2,2,0
I was on Isotretinoin for 6 months during my senior year, ending right before my freshman year of college. The acne i had was really bad, cystic acne and white heads galore. After finishing my first round, my skin was flawless. Then in the winter time of my freshman year, i noticed that my forehead had acne again, nothing bad like before, but there were those little bumps and some whiteheads. I started getting paranoid that my cystic acne would come back, so i made another apt. to try and get on another round. so they put me on again for 3 months. That was the summer before sophomore year of college, and I had ended in the fall time of my sophomore year. fast forward to now and it's the begging of my junior year, and my acne is kind of bad again. Nothing major like before i was on accutane, but it isn't flawless anymore like it was after i finished. i haven't had cystic acne in forever, but it's just those pesky whiteheads popping up on my forehead and cheeks. So i'm thinking it might be time for round 3! unfortunately, my flawless skin from accutane didn't last forever. but, it is no where near as bad as it was before i started it. ,2,2,0
Accutane success rate in adults is 80+% ... these people who get their acne back probably didnt follow strict skin care regimen post accutane and probably ate like shit. i know of 5 people who took accutane and their skin looks pretty much perfect 5+ years after taking it. ,1,1,0
I took accutane about 2 years ago now for 6 months. It took two years but my acne has come back unfortunately. I'm a 25 year old female. I'm not sure I would consider taking it again. ,1,1,0
Congrats, it's exciting. I remember the feeling. The self-consciousness, the embarrassment and anxiety before Accutane. I remember the pale skin, cracked lips, dry eyes and nosebleeds when I was on it. 

And finally the freedom of clear skin. I think I got my braces off that year too. Ah, the confidence I gained was priceless. My skin was clear for like 10 years. But it's been about 5 years of adult acne and I wish I could afford another cycle of that shit. ,2,2,0
Definitely moisturize. ,2,2,0
There's not a lot you really can do, other than moisturize. Drink a lot of water, stay out of the sun, buy Chapstick in bulk. It's rough while you're on it, cracked lips and nosebleeds, the purging process. But totally worth it. Accutane gave me my self-esteem, my social life, my confidence. My skin stayed almost completely clear for like 10 years, but that was 15 years ago. My skin's fucked up right now, I'd sell my soul for another cycle of that Miracle drug. ,1,1,0
You should moisturize, I think, just something light with an SPF. At least I don't remember that being a stipulation. I know it's going to dry out your skin either way. I can't take it again because I can't afford it. It's really expensive and I don't have my Dads health insurance anymore. Although, I don't think it was even covered, maybe partially. I think we paid $400 a month. ,1,1,0
I can't imagine that it will have that much of a difference,1,1,0
I've had it before where I thought my eyelids were stuck to my eyeballs. Not a good feeling. 




You're probably dehydrated. Also try using eye drops before you go to sleep if you're not doing so already. ,1,1,0
This happened to me too, but in my case it was just a slight, annoying discomfort in the first few minutes I was awake. I also noticed that when I used the air conditioner during the night, I had more of this eye problem in the morning. It makes the air drier, so that's why.,1,1,0
Systane is going to be your best friend! Get some and your eyes will feel super hydrated!,1,1,0
I used it for a while and it seemed to help minor things. It started dry my face out so I stopped. 

Honestly it works to an extent but it's not a miracle or anything ,1,1,0
I think I've read that it works just as good as 10%. 

What brand do you use? I picked up Clean & Clear 10% BP and it did nothing for me.,3,3,0
Yep i used generic bp 2.5%. works amazing without much irritation,1,1,0
2.5 will work just as well. I would only use 10% if you have super oily skin,1,1,0
I have never had skin problems and then about a year and a half ago this all came at me at once and i just don't know what to do.. i don't even know what kind of pimples these are. i'm 18 and i just want nice skin. if anyone could help me it'd be greatly appreciated ,1,1,0

I've been on 2 different antibiotics for my skin, and am currently on another set (for about 2 weeks now). I have been prescribed benzoyl peroxide and various other creams.

i am not on accutane, however i have a similar reaction to heat/hot water and according my allergist it's because i have over active histamines-so you could be having a similar problem. mine only occurred when I turned 18, around 5 years ago. A lot of my allergies changed around then. ,3,3,0
Looks like an allergic reaction. I suggest going to the doctor to get it checked out.,1,1,0
I do get it on my forehead and my shoulders + neck and it itches like crazy lol so it's different I guess but mines are smaller.

Calamine lotion helps,1,1,0
If you have insurance, go to a dermatologist.  If you've been suffering long-term with acne and have not found a solution, it's likely you won't without a doctor's care. Please don't think that it's not important enough to be treated by a physician. The prescription medications they have for acne can work wonders over the non-prescription stuff. Give it a try it could change your life for the better. Source: have had cystic acne since I was 12 years old, I'm have been seeing a dermatologist on and off since I was 14,1,1,0
Keep it up with the retinoids, they seemed to have helped my skin a lot! 
Other than that, I use The Ordinary's AHA & BHA serum once a week (on week 5 now and it's helped me so much!), I drink tons of water everyday and switched up my makeup to oil free & non-comedogenic. 

Always double cleanse when removing makeup &
make sure you're using a good moisturiser too! I found that when I religiously moisturise, my skin seemed to clear up really quickly (especially on my forehead). 

If you have any questions feel free to ask, it would also be helpful for us to know your skincare and makeup routine to help pinpoint anything that might be contributing to the problem! ,2,2,0
I have no experience using the BP or the Gel but...

I tried the aha bha route and it didn't do anything about the bumps for me :( surprisingly what helped me was sulphur products. After I wash and tone I use Drunk Elephant moisturizer and then I apply Dr. Gross Colloidal Sulfur mask as a leave on treatment before bed. I saw results after one use. Stopped for a bit because my bf didn't like the smell but I restarted because I haven't found anything else that works as well. ,1,1,0

it looks a bit irritating (microbeads = physical exfoliation, which can irritate skin); camphor and sodium laureth sulfate can also be quite irritating. I would recommend using a gentler wash.

Yeah, going to a derm is going to be your best option. In the meantime, try using a body wash with salicylic acid. Start off using it every other day or every three days to see how your skin reacts, and then if you feel like you can, work your way up to using it every day. If you want to wash your face after exersising, you can, but I personlly would just rinse with water unless it was an extreme workout. This is because cleansing can strip your face of moisture if overused, which in turn leads to more acne. ,5,5,0
Google fungal acne. Change detergent. ,2,2,0
Layering products is totally ok, you just have to make sure you're doing it in the right order. Put everything after cleanser on starting with the thinnest/wateriest products and working your way up to the heavy stuff. There are some exceptions to this rule though. Makeup removers always come first and moisturizer pretty much always goes last. If you're worried, just wait 3 to 5 minutes between each product so your skin can soak everything up.,1,1,0
Why would it? ,3,3,0

Your tooth paste could play a role, I usually always recommend just going to see a deem but in this case with localized lower lip problem it could have to do with the fluoride in toothpaste as I've read that had been the case with other people I your position. Take this with a grain of salt! Skin is complicated !,1,1,0
What you're describing sounds like a cyst/ cystic acne. Seriously though, I know its hard, but don't squeeze it. That's terrible for your skin and when you do that, it's likely to scar. There's not a whole lot you can do for this type of acne unfortunately. My reccomendations would be either a benzyol peroxide spot treatment, mario badescu buffering lotion or hydrocollid bandages. Warning- the first two are likely to dry out your skin in that spot. I agree with the other comment about the toothpaste thing. I'm not sure, but it sorta makes sense.,1,1,0
The location does correlate with that of hormonal acne, and I've experienced that myself with various forms of birth control. If it continues to get worse, I would go back to your doctor and see if there's a lower dosage pill you could try. As for now, try to avoid Vaseline overnight, I would say it's probably doing more clogging than protecting. Try zinc oxide cream, or lotions with zinc oxide in them (Murad acne line) because that acts as a barrier, while treating current acne! Also, a face wash with 1-2% salicylic acid could be helpful. ,6,6,0
Birth control screws up your hormones. Acne can certainly be a symptom of that, along with about 50 other symptoms of hormonal imbalance.,1,1,0
It's likely because of the birth control! It takes awhile for your body to adjust to it, so you may have to deal with breakouts for about 3 months. And probably you'll go back to having clear skin after that. (speaking from my own experience) For the meantime I would ditch the vaseline and try using a wash with salicylic acid, and make sure all your products & sunscreen are non-comedogenic.  ,1,1,0
Hi. I'm wondering what is the best option for dealing with my chest acne. I am currently using Exposed Skincare for about 4 months with no improvement. It seems my problem is more with scars though? Any advice would help.

Past: tried salicylic wash ~6 years ago. Also tried benzoyl peroxide ~6 years ago and not since then, it was around the same time I began using retin-a/tretinoin and maybe one other treatment and my face got pretty raw/irritated. I think it may be worth another try.

also tried oral minocycline no luck

no interest in accutane

I'll go to a derm, but I love reddit so would love to get ideas here first.,2,2,0
I'm currently on what you're on except I use 10% azelaic acid instead. I'm not sure about you but I use both tretinoin and azelaic acid in tandem. 

Maybe increase the percentage of your tretinoin? Do you use things like Mario Badescu drying lotion? That certainly helps with pus-filled zits for me. 

As far as I know, tretinoin is a treatment that can't be stopped. It entails indefinite usage. But hey that's what my derm told me lol. That's why she gradually increased the potency of my tretinoin. Not sure if there's a 1% tretinoin though. ,2,2,0
Have you heard of Tazorac before? Accutane absolutely destroyed my face, and I've had some luck with a combo of peels, tazorac, and benzoyl peroxide. ,1,1,0

Thanks for sharing! I recently joined a gym and this is one of the supplements I have to take (NOW Super Enzymes). Fingers crossed this works for both weight loss AND my skin too! ü§û,2,2,0
Update?,2,2,0
I brought up accutane to my dermatologist-- he was willing to prescribe it since I had taken a multitude of antibiotics and topical treatments and none seemed to help my "moderate" acne. I didn't have a lot of deep/big cysts, but I'd get tiny little *deep* pimples on my back, face, neck, scalp that would never heal and never responded to treatment.   
(Maybe it would help taking photographs of your acne when it's really bad, in case you get a miraculous week of clear skin when it's time for your appointment-- this weird thing always seemed to happen to me when I was a younger and we had no cell phones! This way you could show your dermatologist how bad your skin gets.)   
I think I remember mentioning to my dermatologist that I felt it was hindering me professionally. I was starting to look like a "meth head" because I was already pushing 30, was thin, and had little red scabs/red marks all over my face. You could plead that since you're approaching your mid 20s, you're afraid your skin might make you appear as if you were a drug addict and harm you during job interviews, etc..   
I don't think you *need* to have super severe acne to be prescribed accutane-- but you probably need to have some kind of medical dermatological history where you can justifiably say you've tried *multiple* medical treatments and none of them have worked. I think they call it "recalcitrant acne".  
My insurance at that time covered it since a) I had tried multiple treatments and none of them worked anymore and b) my dermatologist obtained a "prior authorization" from my insurance company to cover it. Prior authorization is when your MD/MD office calls your insurance company and explains to them why you meet the criteria necessary to be prescribed accutane. Some insurances require this, some might not.  
 The medication itself wasn't expensive. What could potentially become expensive is if you need to get blood work every month if your insurance is cr...ppy... I think dermatologists still make accutane patients get blood test to gage their cholesterol levels/triglycerides every month. I had to get blood work every month because I'm female, and I had to do that annoying ipledge thing as well.    
If you have medical insurance, you could maybe go online and check your medical benefits... or call the phone number on the back of the card and ask one of the insurance representatives if your coverage includes Accutane treatment. 
The costs of trying this-and-that-and-this-and-that can add up *very quickly*, so I feel that accutane saved me more money than I would have otherwise spent "experimenting" on treatments.  
Personally, I had fewer side effects from accutane than I did from various antibiotics. I also took accutane twice (two rounds of treatment several months long), despite not having "severe acne". The most annoying side effect was dry skin-- but I honestly have dry skin from antibiotics and acne topicals anyway.  The first four month round worked until a few months after I stopped treatment. My dose was probably too low, but it was based on my weight.   
I had to move out of state and get a new dermatologist. After about two years, the new MD agreed to prescribe accutane to me. I had treatment resistant widespread tiny little cysts on my neck and sides of my face. While my skin still isn't perfect, it never went back to the horrendous state it was at that time. I'll probably always need to use Tazorac gel and Dapsone gel, or something...   

Some people have nasty side effects. One of my relatives had bad gastrointestinal problems-- but he stopped immediately. I'd say if you have any weird gastro side effects when taking it, stop taking it immediately.  

Some dermatologists are reluctant to prescribe accutane if you're on any "depression" or psychiatric medications. I was on an antidepressant both times I was on accutane. My MDs only requested a letter or RX from the doctor prescribing me antidepressants that stated I was stable enough to be prescribed accutane. If you are on an antidepressant, tell your derm that you're certain your psychiatrist would "clear" you for accutane if necessary-- and then ask your psych for a clearance.  

Out of pocket, I'm not sure how much accutane would cost. I can't imagine it would be more expensive than some of the other acne medications out there. You can get coupons for different brand name medications if you search online. I take Aczone topical gel and can get a small discount with their coupon program. You could always ask your dermatologist if there are any coupons/discounts out there.  
The hospital I work at also has a discount program for people under a certain income level regardless of whether they have insurance... they give a huge discount off blood work if you get it done at the hospital's lab. Call around to your local hospitals/laboratories and ask if any of them have a "financial assistance program" for lower income people to offset copays/deductibles. At my work, you can be 300% over the poverty level and get a discount-- they write it off as a charitable tax deduction.   
Hopefully some of this helps. Sorry for the novel!

Go to Epiduo website they explain everything on there. 

In short - your skin builds up a tolerance to it with time. In the beginning it burns. Use every 3 days in the beginning, gradually building up to using it daily. Use on top of moisturiser to further reduce the initial irritation, eventually moving to putting it on before moisturiser. 

It takes 12 months to reach full effect. 

Apply to the entire face (avoid eyes and mouth). 

,3,3,0
I was on daily epiduo and now just use it to spot treat breakouts having been put on a course of antibiotics. From my experience it will irritate your skin a lot at first and over time you will develop the ability to apply daily - but it definitely takes a while. For me I was told to do it daily , but I reached the point where my skin was peeling and painful allday - even more so when I applied moisturiser. So I did it as much as I could , which was every few days. The epiduo definitely helped but I've found antibiotics to be much more helpful for me. 
Best of luck !,3,3,0
I was prescribed epiduo by my Dr after completing a 3-month doxycycline prescription. Safe to say, it peeled my face and washing my face made it painful af. So I steered away from it after two weeks and now I use 0.05% tretinoin and azelaic acid combination instead. 

Tretinoin is usually prescribed in increasing potency. I was given 0.01% then 0.025% and now I'm at 0.05%. ,1,1,0
Yeah but people tell me that it will improve over time,1,1,0
Ty for the reply I am going to try your way,1,1,0
Man oh man...epiduo. I'm going to be short and sweet with this. Had sever cystic acne on my chin. Doctor said to moisturize heavily before applying then apply the epiduo before bed. First day went alright, second day it became Irritated and third day it looked like I had second degree burns on my face. It was painful and very flaky and of course, embarrassing. Instead of applying it every night, I did every other night instead. NEVER APPLY ON YOUR WHOLE FACE - just on the specific spots that need it. My acne on my chin cleared up over a few months - haven't had pimples there in a long long time. But it was about a six month process.  I feel like you just have to hold out and be patient. It's going to get flaky and red and painful, that's the process of it. But if it's too much, I'd only use it every couple days because it can be very painful and uncomfortable. Good luck. ,1,1,0
When do I use it? Well I use to use it every other day for weeks...then the acne went away and I stopped for awhile. I used it last night on a Pimple on my chin that I can feel coming. It's good for preventing acne too. If you feel one coming but it hasn't reached the skin yet, just put some on that spot.,1,1,0
Yeah the cool thing is I had a pimple the head was almost penetrating I applied it then it went away but it's still red ,1,1,0
Ok ty,1,1,0
That's weird cause my doctor specifically said not to use it on my whole face and just the infected areas but whatever works right ,1,1,0
Yh I am not using on my while I am only using it on my pimples and that so yh ,1,1,0
I was told to wash off epiduo after just half hour, and it still did its job without any irritation,0,0,0
I need to know too lol. Pretty sure the zit is dead, but some areas are still red and have texture. ,1,1,0
To remove from the disarray of what's really skin inflammation and so forth, I conversed with some skin care specialists about pimples that aren't generally pimples. Here are five noteworthy skin issues you could be mistaken for skin break out. In the event that you presume you may have any of the conditions beneath, influence a meeting with your dermatologist to locate the best treatment to get ready for you.

1.Rosacea: 
Commonly mistaken for acne, rosacea is a skin condition that causes pus-filled bumps in the central part of the face. But unlike acne, which generally features whiteheads and blackheads on your face and back, rosacea is often associated with facial redness and painful bloodshot eyes.

2.Allergic Reactions:
Allergic reactions can come in many shapes and forms, so it‚Äôs really no surprise that some skin irritations can mimic acne breakouts. However, the key difference between acne and allergic skin reactions is usually intense itching, which comes with red, scaly patches. And yes it's true that acne can be painful, but usually, it doesn‚Äôt itch.

3.Acneiform Eruptions:
Hair products, in particular, can cause acneiform eruptions (often looking like fine red bumps) which appear on the forehead area. These annoying reactions are sort of a cross between acne and allergic reactions but should be treated more like the latter.

4.Chloracne:
While rashes and redness can be annoying, it's most important to keep an eye out for "acne" that's actually a chronic skin disease. Chloracne, for example, can cause pustules, blackheads, and cysts, which definitely resembles your typical sort of acne.,1,1,0
I can just *feel* it. It almost feels itchy.   
A stubborn pimple always feels as if there's something still under my skin.  ,1,1,0
I've found cutting it out completely is the best thing for my skin. I don't miss it now. 

Would probably stress myself out having small amounts not being sure if they're enough to trigger anything. 

Almond milk and rice milk are pretty good (go for unsweetened). ,3,3,0
I eliminated milk for the same reason.. however being European and still living with my parents I find it hard to cut out completely as it's entrenched in my family's diet. Once in a while I'll have cheesy lasagna, a packet of cream in my coffee, etc. I find my acne might flare up a tiny bit, if anything, in response but it's never non-manageable. So it just depends what you want, and it's totally different from person to person. The best response will probably be cutting it all out, but if you don't mind a potential pimple or two, it won't be the end of the world. 

In regards to the dairy free milk, coconut milk is awesome, but I've found it tends to be higher in calories than almond milk. Additionally, if you're getting coffee at Starbucks or other places, some of the coconut milks have carcinogens inside so that's something you need to watch out for. I tend to choose almond milk for everyday use, but cashew milk tastes awesome and is also pretty rich. Totally up to your personal preference! ,1,1,0
I've completely cut of milk in my diet for about 5 years and found comfort in Almond milk and black tea. Go for one that you really enjoy. üëç,1,1,0
Hello! It will really depend on your skin. I cut dairy out 8 months ago and really notice the difference when I eat dairy. For example if I had a splash of milk in one cup of tea, it would be fine - but if I was having that every day it would make a difference. 

However other people's skin may not be as sensitive so you might be alright! 

Over the holidays I ate a single piece of cake made from butter and my acne just went crazy. So now I'm suuuper careful, lol. 

Oh edited to add: my favourite substitute milk is coconut (its really good in milky drinks like hot chocolate). Unsweetened almond milk is probably best to use in cooking as it has less flavour. You can buy Alpro yoghurt and their "plain with coconut" flavour is amazing in curries! :) ,1,1,0
I've cut out milk, gluten, and sugar, also 2 litre of water a day, a wide array of vitamins, clean pillow cases, etc.,1,1,0
I feel you. Pretty much the exact same story as me, I'm in my mid-20's and still break out from time to time. Taking care of my diet/sleep/stress was incredibly helpful, so hopefully you'll see improvements once you get back into healthy habits. 

Birth control was a godsend for my acne. Thankfully the first one I tried was amazing with no side effects (apparently there are some that are prescribed specifically for acne). If you go to a doctor you should ask them to check your hormones, especially with the weird periods and weight gain, there could be some underlying cause for your acne. Good luck!,4,4,0
I'm so sorry to hear OP. You mention having irregular periods, it sounds like something that would not hurt by talking to a qualified medical physician about. Go to the doctor. Get your health checked out. Find a new one if you weren't happy with the old one. ,3,3,0
I'm sorry you are going through this. Sounds like you are under a lot of stress and pressure and that can definitely manifest in physical ways, or exacerbate existing conditions if you do have them. I agree with others that I would start by seeing a GP and explaining what is going on. See if you can make a strategy for how you will deal with the various issues in your life from stress to eating to exercise, healthy living, and finally, products. It's probably going to be a combination of all those things that will help you get back to a better place skin & body wise. Hugs! ,3,3,0
Get checked out at an OBGYN to see if you either have a reproductive problem like PCOS. You might want to ask your general practitioner if you could get checked for thyroid disease or any other endocrine problem. There are a bunch of different diseases women can get that promote acne and weight gain.  
My GP tested me for hypothyroidism when I mentioned that my father had it-- sometimes looking into your family history could help.   
I'd also get an appointment with your derm ASAP. Call them now, because you might have to wait six months for an appointment. *Please don't be worried about being judged*. They want to get the business, anyway. Dermatologists see acne come back after accutane over and over again. I've had two rounds of treatment with accutane as an adult, as did one of my siblings...     
If you're embarrassed about picking, I'd just be honest. I flat out told my dermatologist that, "yeah, I tend to pick at them, they itch and rarely go away on their own. I don't pick my face if I'm having a clear-skin spell". Maybe you could take pictures of your skin when it's really bad with fresh un-picked pimples, just to show proof. Or, you could make your appointment with the derm, and keep your picking down to a minimum the week or two prior to your appointment.    ,1,1,0
Not sure why you want to scar your face more, doesn't sound like a good idea to me. ,2,2,0
I'm not following your thought process of scarring your face more if you are already uncomfortable with your acne scars. I would think people would be more quick to judge and wonder about scarification than acne scars.  I would also be worried about the formation of keloids, which could restrict facial movement and make it painful to smile or chew if you were to scarify your cheekbones. 

I think it's cool elsewhere, and I'm sure it would look great on your back. I just don't think it's the best move for your face. If you're not set on scarification, perhaps you could put the money aside for laser treatments to lighten your acne scars. 

,1,1,0
I think it's a cool idea as long as you don't go overboard. Body modification definitely isn't my thing, but I admire people who can make it part of their style. As long as it doesn't have any negative impact on your life (e.g. employment), why not? 

Can't believe other people are telling you it's something you should be ashamed of. I completely understand how a lot of people here have insecurities, but doesn't mean they should go around telling others they should be insecure, too. Wear your face with pride!,0,0,0
Pure Naturals out of Florida sells Melazepam, which is 20% AA and works really well.  The price is good too.,1,1,0
Not painful I recommend going to Korea for that. ALOTTTTT Cheaper as I said. ALOT. ,1,1,0
No it's not bad at all. My worst side effects were dry lips and nostrils. I think some people have mood swings and depression, but it seems to be manageable. The most annoying part is getting blood work done once a month and having to be on the pill if you're a girl. But it's worth it! Only 6ish months of mild annoyances. ,2,2,0
Not it's not. It actually works really well and you have to take it for 6 months and after that, all your acne will be gone like for real. There are a lot of side effects tho but it's really rare. ,2,2,0
Accutane got me hooked on chapstick for life and taught me how to properly use not one but TWO methods of contraception. I had a wonky liver test on it once but it recovered quickly. There's really not much to worry about and your doc will monitor you. It's a miracle drug!,1,1,0
I am on it now, and I wish I would have taken it sooner! I have also done some research that put me off from starting isotretinoin and I told myself I would only use external methods. I started because a close friend (who had finished the course years ago) told me that there will be scary reviews for absolutely anything. Just know that serious side effects definitely exist, but it's not something that everyone will get. You can always get off it too, but I would definitely recommend at least trying 3 months. My skin got worse in the first three months and started visibly clearing almost 5 months in. If the only thing that is stopping you is your research online, I say give it a go. Talk to your doctor/dermatologist because they can give you information that applies just for you (e.g. depending on your weight, severity, etc) and even then you still have the option to opt out.,1,1,0
My skin and lips were crusty. Crustier than you could ever imagine. But it ends quick and is well worth it. ,1,1,0
Paula's choice all the way!! They have so many amazing moisturizers and thousands of reviews; read the customer reviews to really pick the best one for you! She gives so much information and is very through,1,1,0
Differin has a moisturizer that I use sometimes when my skin is extremely dry (usually when I get a little crazy with the BP cream). It's available on Amazon. However, 90% of the time I just use aloe vera gel.,1,1,0
Ren clearcalm 3 gel cream is amazing.,1,1,0
You can either apply epiduo before or after your moisturiser. When first using it most ppl 'buffer' it with moisturiser first to try and reduce the irritation it can cause. I did this at the start and now I just cleanse, epiduo and moisturise ,1,1,0
Should I use it overnight,1,1,0
I thought you should apply epiduo on its own with nothing on top but I'm not sure. ,1,1,0

I got very severe cystic acne last year and i remember i used calamine lotion at night,, a LOT of calamine lotion, i used to dab it with my fingers all over the area, yes there would be some stains on the pillow cover but the acne would already look better in the morning,1,1,0
This will sound odd but super dilituted bleach water has helped me... Use it in a cotton ball around the area that are my hot spots.. it's the ultimate antibacterial wash ,1,1,0
Lance it using a sanitized needle then put a hydocoloid bandage on it. They're also called blister bandaids.,1,1,0
Do you use an AHA?,1,1,0
Try an AHA moisturizer like Neutrogena Healthy Skin lotion.

Depending on the type and severity of the dark areas on your skin, you may be able to avoid a visit to the dermatologist and instead lighten your own skin. ,1,1,0
What exactly are you referring to?,4,4,0
I have acne too, I just went into Sephora and had one of the employees match me a foundation for my skin type and I also bought some concealer. 
As for clearing it up, I probably won't be of much help in that department. I've tried almost everything under the sun to get rid of my mild/moderate acne and it won't go away so I'm getting ready to go on accutane. ,1,1,0
Leave the epiduo on.  I would put the epiduo on, leave it there alone for 30 minutes minimum, then put on moisturizer.  It needs to stay on to help your skin.,1,1,0
I mean a layer of epiduo then put on moisturizer on top of the epiduo,1,1,0
Now I get it thank you so much,1,1,0
No pics, so the only advice we can give is let your body heal on its own and stop using a knife on your face ,7,7,0
You really used a knife for ur face just leave it might heal,1,1,0
Reddit is confusing on an iPhone can't find a way to put pictures,1,1,0
I have pretty sensitive skin and I have been using witch hazel as a toner, and putting a drop of tea tree oil in my moisturizer. Seems to be helping :) ,2,2,0
Moisturizer! Anything to heal, not strip away. I use 100% rose hip oil and Kate Somerville Goat milk cream. The cream is expensive but go for anything with natural ingredients, that aren't five paragraphs long. When you heal a cut on your skin, the best way to avoid scarring is to keep it sealed with moisture, think what healthy ways you want to not strip (i.e. Tea tree is good for stripping oils, think about something that will heal.),1,1,0
Prefer drinking enough water for proper removal of waste products that will allow your skin to clean up most of the waste products that may be reason of acne formation. Wash your face alternatively in intervals. ,1,1,0

12 8 oz glasses a day, I think.  Just drink when you're thirsty and stop when you don't want to drink more.  Listening to your body is the best thing to do.  Soda isn't good for you anyway.,3,3,0
A gallon is best i isually have 2 cups when i wake up then i constantly drink water till around 7 ,1,1,0
OMG that stuff will strip your skin off. Be careful!!! To start, i would say every 3/4 days. Moisturizer as much as possible with something that will heal. I use rosehip oil, Kate Somerville goat milk cream. When my skin is really acting up i have a cucumber gel mask from Peter Thomas Roth i keep in the fridge, its totally soothing!!!! Do not scrub face either!! It will get better the epiduo is magic, but be careful. ,2,2,0
Thank you for the reply but when do I apply the moisturizer and when I apply the epiduo then wash it off do I put the moisturizer on my face ??? I am just new to this moisturizer thing. U are my hero for replying ,1,1,0
I haven't used it.  The consistency and ingredients is what I'd look into,  try it out and if you feel any irritation,  try something else. I like creams that are rich as possible with the medication, and I feel like I've heard that one isn't as thick. ,1,1,0
Oh yh,1,1,0
I am just new to this acne crap,1,1,0
So you apply the epiduo then put the moisturizer u use over  the epiduo while it is still on your face,1,1,0
Epiduo, let it sit on your skin. You have to really feel it absorb into your skin, then when it's dry enough soothing moisturizer.,1,1,0
Ok thank you so much,1,1,0
First, stop using everything for your face!!

Use ONLY basis soap twice a day, cleared me up and my friends.,1,1,0
Tried that already bro didn't work 
,1,1,0
Never use stuff that ur body doesn't like don't use salycic acid If ur skin is dry go to the professionals and say it doesn't fit ur type,1,1,0
My skin doesn't like benzoyl peroxide *or* salicylic acid.  
Even though they're considered "stronger", I think glycolic acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid cleansers burned my skin less. I've always had better luck with non-medicated cleansers on my face, regardless of what acne treatments I was going through.   
You might want to try a cleanser that is non-medicated, and use a topical that has something other than salicylic acid. 
Maybe wash your skin with cetaphil or something mild until the red dryness improves?  
Maybe benadryl would help-- topical or pill-- for the rash? 
I'd definitely consider going to a doctor in the meantime if your skin is really inflamed. You might be having an allergic reaction. Calling a dermatologist and setting up an appointment wouldn't hurt, if you can, although you might have to wait a few months.  ,1,1,0
I have tried everything you did and nothing worked.

First of all stay AWAY from the nasty chemical washes, they might "work" but they ruin your face overtime.. you are putting harmful chemicals on your face

I cleared my acne with basis soap, be consistent and give it a try,1,1,0
Waiting for the comments. ,1,1,0
Haven't tried the home kits but I've done micro needling in the past (one of three) and I can say that it has helped my scars fade away. Unfortunately I broke out again 2 weeks after my first roll and haven't been back for my second or third appointment for about 8 months due to constantly breaking out.

Overall, my first derma roll helped fade away a few scars but wouldn't have been much of an effect if I completed all 3 rolls. Right now, my skin is looking pretty bad due to going through acne again and I'm hoping to finish my last two rolls after November (?),1,1,0
Do u have a sweaty back?  Try to shower after ur workout and try using cool back sheets,1,1,0
I had it like you. Now I'm just left with scars.

I used Clindimyicin and Benzoyl Peroxide lotion every night along with washing it with Apple cider Vinegar. ,1,1,0
Ugh so painful. I had cystic acne. What has he given you to heal? ,1,1,0
Get it removed by a derm and do not pick or try to do it yourself . I did that and I needed up getting a very serious staph infection on my face. Let me tell you - you don't want that. I would just find a dr and have it professionally removed . I didn't do that and now I am dealing with a world of trouble and pain. ,1,1,0
As far as preventative measures go, you want to make sure that you're exfoliating properly when there's no cysts. This ensures that there's no buildups of dead skin on or around the nose. This happens to me too. Exfoliating really helps keep these at bay. 

I find, when I feel a cyst coming on, warm compresses help control swelling. Additionally, applying an ice cube when you feel one coming, on and off for 10 minutes, lowers pain and swelling too. These tips usually help me bring the pimple to a head, where they're easier to treat with topical medications like salicylic acid etc.

You're doing the right thing by going to your doctor to get them removed! I hope these little tips and tricks help you out.  ,1,1,0
No it's not... It's completely normal... It's just a new hair... It happens with me alot of times after waxing my legs when a new hair tends to grow first it gets bumpy then if I try to remove it a curly hair comes out... ,1,1,0
What's your routine in regards to your skin? Have you been to see your GP about it?,1,1,0
Might be genetics, but; you might want to go see your doctor about this. Sounds pretty weird when you stopped using steroids, You got acne. What soaps do you wash your face with, are these pimples grouped together or blemishes. What is your "normal diet" consist of? How is the weather where you live; is it hot which causes you to sweat? How are your parents genetics. Please be specific ,1,1,0
Also, show us pictures ,1,1,0
I'm vegan, and Ben and Jerrys non dairy ice cream is the bomb.com!!!! ,8,8,0
There are some great vegan dairy substitutes. At first, they will taste bad, but if you go long enough without milk or cheese they start to taste pretty good. Check out some online vegan youtubers like hotforfood; she makes great "nacho cheese"! ,7,7,0
You can literally live without cheese, congratulations anyway :-),5,5,0
I used to think the same thing, but it's so easy going without cheese in 2017! ,5,5,0
Hmm maybe I should try this,3,3,0
Ehh I honestly haven't found a good cheese substitute after going daity free.  Soy, which a lot of vegan products are made of, aggravates my hormones and gives me acne.,1,1,0
I'd recommend avoiding cheese substitutes for a little while so you can forget what dairy cheese tastes like. Or, you can eat them now, but just don't expect them to taste like dairy cheese or you will probably be disappointed. I like to think of them as a totally different, and tasty, food.

You mention above that you liked to sprinkle grated cheese on your food. You could try nutritional yeast flakes. (Not the same thing as the yeast you'd use to make bread, it's a different product altogether) They give you the same experience of sprinkling a savory seasoning on your food, and add a tasty flavor to things. Bonus - it contains loads of protein and vitamins!,1,1,0
Tried it for like 2-3 weeks, didn't see ant change,1,1,0
From my own exprience and how it affected me, dairy may not really the issue but it might be more the cheese and the yeast that affects the acne. If you cut it out completely for a month and you see some improvements, you could try some cheese or bread and wait 4 days to see if there are any reactions. You can try yeast free breads such as soda bread and sourdough. Also chocolwte is really bad for my acne and I get really bad breakouts when I do. Cutting down significantly on the amount of sugar you eat will also help. ,1,1,0
Nope. Cheese is my favourite food so it pretty much sucks. 

Going dairy free is really not that hard if you live in a city in 2017 and I've found great substitutes for everything, EXCEPT CHEESE. 

I love cheese so much that I'd rather go without than force down the pale immitation of vegan "cheese" but it's a tragedy. At Christmas I let myself go crazy on brie and then just deal with the fallout lol. 

That was my cheese rant. I'm sorry. ,1,1,0
Ice in a bag reduces redness. Drink a lot of water, like a gallon a day, and stay away from fried or greasy foods. ,3,3,0
Chin acne are result of Hormones ,1,1,0
Personally, judging from what I see of your face, you seem handsome enough that girls probably won't notice the acne.  
When I was younger, I had acne. Whenever I saw a guy with a few zits, I never *judged* them badly for it, since I could empathize with their pain and also knew that guys tended to have worse acne in their teens/early 20s.  
Could also be perioral dermatitis or Tinea barbae (fungal infection men sometimes get in beard area from shaving). Both problems involve acne-like bumps around the mouth/beard area,  
Maybe getting a new or different kind of razor would help. I use a double-edged safety razor (don't shave my face, though, I'm female) and have had fewer skin problems in the areas I shave. My one sibling swears by an electric razor for his face, and he was always acne prone.  
If you get the chance, see a doctor-- just so you don't drive yourself crazy trying to experiment with different treatments.   ,1,1,0
Sounds like you could potentially have PCOS - cystic acne, can't have estrogen, have migraines. Do you have any other symptoms? 
I find what has helped my cystic acne is taking vitamin a, e and d, plus zinc, biorage oil and saw palmetto. A, e and D and Zinc help to repair damaged skin, biorage oil helps with inflammation and saw palmetto is good for PCOS (like spironolactone but much weaker) ,5,5,0
You need to see a dermatologist.  Have you tried birth control?,3,3,0
Tanning is the only thing I've found that helps my acne. It clears it up about 80%. As soon as I stop, and I have stopped for long periods of time (6+ months), this happens all over my face. Forehead, cheeks, upper lip, jawline, some on my back/shoulders. Mostly deep cysts. I've separately tried differin (retinoids), 10% benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, lemon juice, and witch hazel, which actually seemed to make it worse. Coconut oil and shea butter help somewhat. Tanning helps it so much, but I know tanning is horrible for you so I want to find a better solution. Anyone have a similar situation? I don't understand why only tanning seems to help. 24/F 5'8" 140 lbs. I rarely eat dairy or processed food. ,2,2,0
DIFFERIN,1,1,0
Thank you everyone for talking with me. You've all been so helpful.,1,1,0
Know I'm late to the game, but tanning is short term.. in the end the new skin forming will be darkened by the sunlight and ultimately will damage the new tissue. Talk to a doc and try to keep out of the sun. ,1,1,0
I had acne just like that in my early 30s-- on the sides of my face and my neck!  
Trying to experiment with multiple at-home treatments broke my bank, so I'd suggest seeing a dermatologist as soon as possible. I'd also suggest seeing your gyn to check to see if you're having PCOS.  
My dermatologist was willing to prescribe accutane, because I had taken so many other acne treatments prior to that. I also had a Mirena at that time, and I think it probably made the acne worse than it would have been otherwise.    
I was one of those people who had worse acne with *any kind of birth control*.  ,1,1,0
I started to see results after about a month, but that was with 10% BP -- not sure how much of a difference 2.5 and 10% would make in practice.

"Seeing results" in my case just meant less acne, though. I was never acne-free using benzoyl peroxide, and it resulted in a lot of my shirts and pillowcases getting bleach stains on them.,3,3,0
Give it about a month and a half. It irritates and then works like a charm. ,1,1,0
In the U.K. The NHS recommends that with any acne that isn't on your face you should visit a doctor to look at ways to get rid of it.  I'm personally an accutane and although my face is worse than my back my consualtant dermatologist told me my back will likely take longer to clear up as it's notorious for being difficult to treat.  Good luck!,2,2,0
I've had success with benzoyl peroxide wash. And others have mentioned success with using stridex pads.,1,1,0
r/accutane my friend ,1,1,0
I have no advice for you- but I am 100% with you in this exact same situation!! I'm breastfeeding my 17 month old and wanting to start for #2 in a few months but my whole face is broken out and has been for months, and I even have cystic acne on my chin and jawline. I have completely stopped wearing makeup and I've tried every cleanser you can think of and even using just coconut oil or plain water- basically nothing makes any difference at all. My skin just sucks right now! Have you gotten your period back since having your baby? I'm thinking that maybe it's hormones for me since I haven't gotten mine. Anyway- you aren't alone!!,1,1,0
Ok. So i have had no children, but the same acne issue. I will say that this is what has helped heal mine, unsure if it will be affected by your desire to have more children or breastfeeding. Good luck, talk to your doctor. 

-Sodium sulfectamide 10% sulfur 2% cleanser at night
-clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel 1.2% / 5%
-The ever expensive epiduo forte which has healed mine completely. ,1,1,0
Because everyone reacts differently to the medication with different side effects, you need to contact your doctor who has your medical records. ,2,2,0
Assuming you can't get in touch with your doc for some reason to ask, Will you be "missing out" in any way by playing it safe and foregoing the booze? 

I know drinking is fun and it makes work events even better, the social norms etc. but I assume there are already plenty of professionals who attend these events and do not drink (for whatever various reasons). Unless you work in the wine industry and this is some kind of vendor tasting or something I don't see any reason you couldn't just play it safe with your body and give it a couple of weeks. 

The best advice is to call your doctor. Barring that you just have to personally decide between the perks of boozing it up vs. the possibility of there being risks. ,1,1,0
Totally agreed with contacting your doctor with this question. In addition, if I were in your shoes I'd play it safe and not drink given you've just completed the accutane course. Just not worth messing with your liver function which would affect you the rest of your life. You can drink things that socially will look like alcohol so people won't bother you (eg bubbly water with a lime in it, soda, etc). And if someone finds out you're not drinking *and* confronts you about it, just say you're taking a med right now that doesn't let you drink. Chances are (1) most people won't notice you're not drinking (2) if they notice, they won't care (3) if they notice and care and confront you (a lot of ifs), they'll accept your explanation.,1,1,0
Regarding #1 and #5, everyone's skins react differently to products so experiment with different product to see which works the best for you. The drugstore has many affordable options out there so research and see which one you might be interested in.  If your existing cleanser is good, then there is no need to venture out and trying different products. Regarding #3, toner is optional as stated so it's completely up to you. Regarding #4, you ask whether you should use a face wash containing benzoyl peroxide. You can if you want but you may experience dryness. Also, these products tend to cost a lot more in comparison to how efficacious they are since the cleanser can only stay on your face for so long. You can just use a BP topical every day instead.

Last but not least, treat sunscreen at least as part of your skin care hygiene. It's extremely important to protect yourself from the sun since exposure can also worsen hyperpigmentation. 

I know using a moisturizer sounds counter intuitive but moisturizer should be used every day. You will experience dryness with BP so please do not forget to moisturize.,1,1,0
I think you might have skipped 2.,1,1,0
1.  The "gentle cleanser" would be your regular soap, so you don't need two different products for that (unless you just want to).  I personally prefer Cerave-- if your face feels tight and dry use the HYDRATING one, if you are more oily use the FOAMING one.  I personally like the foaming one better as it feel more like normal soap.  The hydrating one feels like rubbing lotion all over your face and it doesn't really suds up (Cetaphil is the same as the hydrating one to me).

3.  You do not have to use toner at all and it's fine if you're not interested in trying to work it in.

4.  I would not get BP in a soap since I think you'd do better with the soap I mentioned in #1.  Also as someone else mentioned, the BP in a soap will only be on your face for a couple of seconds (which generally isn't enough) and would maybe dry you out unnecessarily.  If you want some BP I would try to find some that is either a lotion or just a topical gel sort of thing.  You can spot treat with that instead of putting it all over your whole face since it is drying.

Salicylic acid can be used the exact same way (doesn't have to be in a toner which you don't want)--in a lotion or gel type of thing.  There are also a lot of "spot treatment" items at the drugstore that are fine.  

The main thing is that these two ingredients are different.  BP is like an antibiotic that will kill the bacteria making your breakouts.  Salicylic is an exfoliater that clears out your pores.  If you have big oilly pores I would go for the Salicylic since it can make your face skin look very nice.  BP will kill your breakouts but it won't do your face skin any favors that I am aware of.  

5.Yep just apply moisturizer after you wash your face and after treatments.  I like the Crave AM and PM ones.  The AM has sunscreen (which you will need to be using as well BTW) and the PM doesn't.  

So if I were you I'd do something like this:

AM--
Cleanse with gentle cleanser,
Use the BP or Salicylic product of your choice,
Try to wait 20-30 minutes (if you can't that's okay),
Apply the Creave AM facial lotion that contains sunscreen (or something similar),

PM--
Cleanse with gentle cleanser,
Use the BP or Salicylic product of your choice,
Try to wait 20-30 minutes (if you can't that's okay),
Apply the Crave PM focial lotion that does not contain sunscreen (or something similar),

HOpe that helps out :)

Usually all I can do about those is give them an extra dab of moisturizer (something thick like Nivea creme can work quickly), and pat it in some. Maybe give it a few minutes to soak in, wipe away the excess, and then try applying your makeup. It should help your makeup go on smoother hopefully!
Edit: oh primers also help with this! Basically putting a clear layer of makeup between the scab and your foundation should keep it from getting all caked in and dried up. ,2,2,0

So you did find out that these foods were causing breakouts? Can I ask, how long after restricting these did you notice skin clarity? ,2,2,0
Damn seems like your good at connecting what effects your skin. Whenever I have a breakout I can't think of what could have caused it. I do eat a lot of cereals that have processed sugars so maybe I should just go on a strict Whole Foods diet for a while. ,1,1,0
The cleanser is very likely breaking you out because it is drawing out all of the gunk to the surface of your skin. This is actually a good thing because it means your skin will resolve itself faster. I know it's worrying to see new blemishes appear, but know that those would have eventually appeared later (the cleanser is just making them appear sooner so your skin will clear sooner). 

However, if after a week or two you're still breaking out, maybe switch to a different cleanser. It's possible your skin could be reacting to a certain ingredient which is causing it to freak out and break out. ,1,1,0
What cleanser/moisturizers are you using? I was using cetaphil and neutrogena while using the same topical treatments as you. When I switched to trader joe's antioxidant facial wash & moisturizer (both available on amazon) my acne greatly decreased (still present but much much better).,2,2,0
Take cold showers, that closes your pores. Plus feels great in the summer. Shown to keep someone consistently more relaxed.

Try changing your diet. I just realized dairy was causing all of my acne. I couldnt go 2 days without getting new pimples and now that I gave up dairy im completley free of acne,1,1,0
Yes do that. Ween off of them! Start by taking once a day and then once every other day and so on..

I took it four times. Each time i believed it helped my acne but my acne always came back. This might be because of my hormones though. 

The thing about this is that antibiotics will kill the good bacteria as well as the bad bacteria. So it's not too good which is why i stopped. I took it four times because i was so desperate and i think that might be the reason i am also still breaking out, i might have also messed up my gut. So now i am drinking kombucha and going to start taking probiotics to get the good bacteria back.

So after you ween off of it try some probiotics! If you don't want to take pills then drink some kombuca, eat some yogurt!,1,1,0

Hey man, I've been on minocycline before, about 8 months ago and I had a blood test recently and they didn't say anything to me about white blood cell count. However that was after 8 months, so who knows what it was like before. Honestly I wouldn't over think it, I doubt you've got a serious illness, your body is a tough thing, I'm sure it'll bounce back. You asked your doc if minocycline could affect white blood cell count?,2,2,0
Hey, my case looked pretty similar to yours about a few months ago. What I would suggest is to completely eliminate soda from your diet and drink just water. (A lot of it)

Also I'd suggest trying oxy-pads. It has 2% salicyclic acid so I only use it once a day after I wash my face as it can dry out skin easily. After that I use rose water as a toner to keep my skin from tightening or drying out. Those two things have really made a huge difference in my skin, and they're not a hassle to use at all. (Cheap too)

Good luck!,7,7,0
Noxzema isn't really good for your skin, so I'd stop using that. If you're in America, I suggest buying some Stridex BHA (red box) at your local drugstore and using it once a day at night. Note that you should start off using it every three days for a week or two, then every two days, then every day. If you use it too often too quickly, your unadjusted skin will dry out and make everything worse.

When you use acids/have acne, you need to wear SPF to prevent burns (even if you don't usually burn/tan) and darkening of spots. I say find a moisturizer you like with at LEAST SPF 20-30. You can use another moisturizer at night that doesn't have SPF. Personally, I'd recommend Cerave PM for night. Their AM lotion (that has SPF) might have a white cast that turns you ashy, so check out some reviews on that first!,2,2,0
Quit the soda and you'll lose weight and the acne,2,2,0
Cut out dairy too, it clogs pores and can also make them bigger... at least for me. My face rarely gets a single zit after avoiding sugar and dairy.

I recommend buying/using a charcoal sponge when you wash your face. Pacifica seafoam face wash is what I use, followed by Thayer's rose petal witch hazel. Then I moisturize with a little almond oil because if my face gets too dry it'll start producing a bunch of oil and bam... zits.,2,2,0

That was me(26F)  last year ! Worst break out of my life all on my right cheek of my face. I was depressed, low self esteem, I put layers and layers of makeup. I tried the dermatologist but the stuff they gave me made it worse or peeled my skin. I don't even eat bad. But I did a stomach cleanse in case it was digestive acne it helped a lot but then noticed my face acting up again so I just did a lot of home remedies like turmeric and aloe vera mask, I even drank tumeric tea. And to wash my face and take off my makeup I used grapeseed oil. And within 3 months my skin started to feel mine again and I wore less makeup and honestly it worked for me. You can try and see but do a skin test before applying turmeric to your face ,1,1,0
This is what cleared up my face... not a single zit(unless I mess up and eat cheese):

Avoid all sugar and dairy (except butter and yogurt, for some reason they don't clog my pores). I use a charcoal sponge to wash my face with Pacifica seafoam face wash... tone with Thayer's rose petal witch hazel and then moisturize with a little almond oil.

Amazon usually has good deals on the witch hazel, I highly recommend at least that product.,1,1,0
Oh man, that is frustrating! I recommend getting your eating habits back on track, making sure you're drinking plenty of water, and taking a daily multivitamin. Stridex pads are the shiz, but they really should only be used at most twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. You mentioned your skin is getting dry, and that can actually cause more acne and irritation, while making it harder for your skin to heal scars. Are you using a moisturizer? Any other changes in products recently? What's your skincare routine like? ,1,1,0
Are you on the athletic/thin or skinny fat/overweight side as of recently? Have you been exercising? What's your race/ethnicity? Have you been having stomach issues? What kind of acne? Small- or cystic?

It's hard for me to determine your problem (which is likely due to stress and gut flora) because I've had acne since 14 that is moderate to severe, along with oily skin. I'm 25, and it has been on-and-off for years now- likely hormonal in nature.

You really need to stop picking- unless the whitehead of the zit is easily visible, do not pop it- and if you do, make sure you do it at a time when the skin is clean and you can easily wash the area.

If you fuck around with the deep red pustules it's just gonna get worse, deeper, redder, and more engorged. 

Could be that the recent stress of moving, the differences in the tap water harshness, and work have all influenced your facial and gut bacteria. Look up some highly rated probiotics and try them out. apple-cider vinegar as a face-wash on a cotton pad has been working wonderfully for me recently.

You are also likely drying out your face too much with the stridex- you said you have dry skin- correct? overdrying your skin with harsh astringents will only increase the wrong kind oil and sebum production if done regularly. Try the ACV instead.

Yeah I use a little bit of concealer when it gets bad. I never try to make them 100% invisible though, I only use the tiniest amount to lessen the redness a bit.,7,7,0
 Not a dude but hopefully I can help! I wouldn't expect a lot of coverage from BB creams or tinted moisturizers, I'd get a good skin color concealer as well as a green concealer to counteract the redness. r/makeupaddiction is a good place for advice if you've never worn makeup.

There's also these thin hydocolloid patches, they're great especially for acne I can't or don't want to put makeup on.

Usually using an AHA and BHA are great for the marks you have left behind (sounds like hyperpigmention). 
Since you're on isotretinoin I'd be careful about using AHA and BHA since your skin is probably sensitive and dry already- definitely ask your derm first.,2,2,0
Not a guy, but if you put on a foundation/BB properly, it shouldn't be noticeable.

If you are gonna go the foundation route, get it properly colour matched or get help from a regular foundation wearer. Don't be ashamed, guys can wear makeup. And besides, it's not even 'fashion makeup', it's to make your skin look 'normal.' 

If you put on foundation, for the most natural look, your foundation should be light/medium coverage. Moisturise well before, make sure your skin isn't too dry and always properly remove it thoroughly.

Foundation can look natural if done properly, but you do have to make sure you develop and refine how you put it in. I used to put foundation on terribly and I've done it for years, so it does take some time to work out how best to do it.

Sorry about your acne. I don't have cystic acne, just slightly bad pimples and it hate it. Cystic is my worst nightmare. Well done for hanging in there, please also go back to the doctors if nothing works. Good luck.,2,2,0
I think about it often, however whenever I've used the tea tree/witch hazel concealer I have in the past, the spot looks even more obvious due to my poor application skills... and then theres the worry that the makeup will just make it worse.

I went to London last weekend and had one of the largest Nodules under my lip that I've ever seen. I wore a hyrdocolloid over it, and although the plaster was noticeable, it did make me feel a lot less anxious than it would have the hugely inflammed spot been on display.,1,1,0
I'm a guy and I've used a Vichy concealer stick in the past. It works better for covering up scabs/healing spots (as they are flat) than blind pimples (you can still see the "bump" despite the skin tone).

I wouldn't recommend using it regularly as it suffocates and can irritate what's underneath. For dates and important occasions I used it. Definitely a short-term fix to a long-term problem. ,1,1,0
I use Est√©e Lauder Double Wear as it stays forever and the coverage is good. Yet at the same time it's not too heavy. Do you have any female friends you feel comfortable discussing it with? 

If it's going down that's great. :) It can take a while, but it'll be worth it.

Also, don't worry about the scars right now. The redness could be hyper pigmentation, which has always faded for me. There are treatments for scars which stay as well, but time can really help them. ,1,1,0
I am kinda the same. I get terribly inflamed pustules and nodules under my lips and around the chin.

Been pretty much Gluten/Dairy/Sugar free since February... The first few months were amazing, even though I lost maybe 2 stone in weight. I could happily deal with that, aslong as the spots stayed away.

Then about 4 weeks ago, they started to come back. I did a bit of reading and it appears 'crash diets' can initially clear up acne, but it does tend to return after a while.

IT's likely the hormones for me. I'm going back to my Derm on Saturday and have a refferal from my GP to talk to someone about Anxiety.
Still eating healthy though...

Good luck to you.,1,1,0

I don't know if that's true, but I did use rodan and fields for 3 years and I'm telling you now it's a bigggg waste of money. The products at first did make me break out more initially (which I find most do) I think your skin just has to get used to it. I think it took me 3 weeks or so to see a difference. It did help a little bit, but for the amount of money I was spending on products I always thought my skin should have looked better. I'm not sure what kind of acne you have, but maybe it will work better for you. I have mostly problems with cystic breakouts on my chin and blackheads that eventually turn into cysts if not treated. I found the rodan and fields didn't do much of anything for my blackheads, even trying the microdermabrasion wash and everything. Eventually my cystic pimples started coming back and I said fuck this and switched to Exposed. It's much cheaper and it did take about 2 months but my skin slowly got a lot better. Right now I do still struggle with some cysts that have been popping up (I've been using exposed since January and their probiotic supplement since June). But, I'm also going through the most stressful time in my life right now and I think that's where my breakouts are coming from. My skin was looking the best it has ever looked about a month and a half ago, and then my ex dumped me and I've been an emotional wreck ever since and I'm pretty sure that's where my new breakouts have been coming from.

But anyways, expensive doesn't always mean better, and I really think rodan and fields is just a scam to make you spend money. My sister works for them and even because of that I'm not impressed with them. She still struggles with breakouts and often tells me she doesn't know if it is the best for her skin anymore, but since she sells it she gets everything free or really cheap so I guess that's why she never stopped. I just think there's a lot of better options out there that won't break your bank. Taking a probiotic with vitamin A made my skin clear up immediately. ,2,2,0
I've wondered that too since I've often heard that these ingredients can be irritating. Yet, I don't believe they really stay on your skin long enough to do much harm..... About a year I stopped using cleansers made especially for acne, though, and just use one for deep pore cleaning. It's just as effective for me. I haven't had any more or less breakouts.,2,2,0

I've never heard of the Tony Lab product, but The Cure is my holy grail exfoliant! It doesn't exactly treat acne, but I think it does help prevent new pores from clogging up, but for me I use it primarily for when my skin is flaking due to my acne treatment (BP) drying me out. It makes my skin go from crusty and flaky and dry to smooth as a baby's bottom. And it's worth the price. I've been using it like 3 times a week for the past 6 months and I still have a little over half a bottle,1,1,0

First off, you're not a disgusting leper. Pedophiles are disgusting, murderers are disgusting... not teenage guys who have acne. They are normal and acne cannot be helped. Your self confidence sounds absolutely shot to bits and for that reason alone I would consider accutane.

Make an appointment. Have some tests. Talk about the side effects/risks and weigh it up. Then think about the state you're mentally in now. Which one is the worse of the two evils? 

My heart goes out to you. It does sound like it's ruining your life. As for girls, any decent girl would not be disgusted by it. 

As a girl, my advice on how to handle the situation would be to tell girls beforehand. Confide in them, and tell them about the acne. If a guy told me he had acne before we were about to hook up, I think I'd realise how he was feeling and make sure I didn't contribute to him feeling worse. Also bear in mind acne is pretty common within teenagers, so most girls should be able to understand how you are feeling to an extent. 

And remember that the acne won't be there forever. One day it will be gone.

Seriously, try and get a derm appointment and talk about what you're going to do next. Even if you don't get accutane, there are other treatments which can help with inflammation and pain. Good luck.,2,2,0
I understand that. Girls wear foundation sometimes, so it's hard to see if they even have bad skin sometimes. Some people have not even realised I have spots sometimes as my makeup has covered it so well.

And of course teenagers have spots, but it's often mild. I get that you feel much worse as your acne is more advanced. Like, I feel bad enough with a few on my cheeks. I can't imagine what you feel like.

I also get that saying "girls won't care" and actually believing it are two different things. And if your acne is sore and bleeds, it adds a different dimension. 

Is seeing a derm something you can do? It is said a LOT on this sub. But in reality it can cost a lot and is not a possibility for everyone.

If I were you, I'd go on the accutane. But that's just me. It really does sound it's have a massive, massive negative impact on your life and no one should have to go through that. I really hope it gets better for you. 

Hang in there.,1,1,0
TLDR: I Had bad body and face acne, went on accutane which cleared up back acne. Used a different method to clean up face acne.

Ihatemyskin123 I have been in a similar situation you. Jr year of high school my acne on my back exploded, colonizing all over my back and chest. This is deep red irritated acne with some white pimples. Face was clear.

I was on the swim team too, so during practices and meets it was embarrassing. I could almost tone it out, but see a person look at me and think "theyre judging me". 

I went on accutane for a year. I can laugh about now, the first month was the most brutal. It felt similar to going through puberty again so like emotional roller coaster. My lips dried up like a raisin, but theres chapstick.

You'll have to get your blood drawn once a month to monitor your organs.

So months after getting off accutane my face broke out bad. Soon I took cold showers everyday (I think this is one of the best things).  

vitamin A everyday

What my dermatologist told me to do to get rid of redness was to wear sunscreen every single day. Not just moisturizer with sunscreen, actual face sunscreen with a higher SPF.. like 45. If you wear the sunscreen every day, over time the redness could go away. But it could take a year or longer,2,2,0

I just wanted to see if anyone has had anything like this also happen to them‚Ä¶

I do not know what this tiny white lump is, also do not know if it is in a scar/hyperpigmentation, or is the remnants of the pimple that was there beforehand.

This ‚Äúthing‚Äù started as an underground pimple that never got a head. I never popped it, I just left it to go away by itself. It did ‚Äì it left a hard lump though that I could get between my fingers (gross). This lump became inflamed after 3 weeks. I popped it this time despite no head still. Pus did come out, albeit a little amount. It scabbed over, the scab fell off on its own, yet the lump (smaller this time round nonetheless) was still there. I ‚Äì out of sheer rage ‚Äì took a needle to it and dug around and popped it again. Scabbed over, fell off, my skin was flat and smooth, no more lump! However, a couple of days later this ‚Äúclosed comedo‚Äù started emerging.
  
It is located right next to an indentation on my face that I‚Äôve had ever since I can remember (not caused by acne). From the photo you can see it‚Äôs also sat in some hyperpigmentation which is basically where this pimple was so the lump that it let behind certainly has shrunk. It has been about 4 weeks now since the last scab came off, I have left it alone and not put anything on it in case of irritation. 

Has anything like this happened to anyone before? What exactly is it? Is it a scar? The remnants of the pus? An unfortunately placed closed comedo? 

Also any advice on what to do with it? I am planning of leaving it alone until I can get to my GP and get his advice.

Lel I got Accutane without insurance in Saudi Arabia for $30 per month (Roche brand) and I later found out you didn't even need a PRESCRIPTION, just walk in to a pharmacy and grab it.

I'm a pharmacy tech and I also took my fair share of antibiotics for acne. The problem with antibiotics is that you can't take them forever because you'll build up a resistance. With Minocycline, there are some other side effects that can occur. Minocycline and Doxycycline are the most common I see. Amoxicillin would be the next most common. I have also seen Keflex prescribed. Diflucan is an anti-fungal that I often see prescribed for acne. The medication that helped me is called Aldactone. It's technically a blood pressure medication but it can be used as an anti-androgen. It was THE best thing I used. Cleared my face up so well! Hope this helps ,1,1,0

I've tried this when I have a lot of breakouts and yes, it works wonders for me! When I wake up, they're all noticeably smaller and sometimes even practically gone. I always apply a mixture of aloe vera gel and jojoba oil first just so that it doesn't dry out the area.,1,1,0
This thread kinda gave me a bit of a wakeup all.

When I first started using BP 15 years ago, I'd really slather it on, but over the years I've certainly started scrimping on the amount i use which is possibly why I'm starting to struggle again recently.

I'll be hyper dosing that shit going forward. Cheers for the clarity bump, OP.,1,1,0
Did you use moisturizer during this method? I have really oily skin and i cant tell if moisturizer is making my acne worse or better.,1,1,0
I love rosehip seed oil.  My skin is combo and has been acne prone for ever. On the comedogenic scale it's listed as a 1.  (compare to coconut oil, which is a 4!) So its much less likely to break you out.  It's nice too, if you have some scarring or have mature skin, as its supposed to be regenerative, or will help accelerate the turnover of your skin cells.  I like to mix it with emu oil and tamanu oil - even a few drops of neem oil to make it more antibacterial.,2,2,0
I use it every night after a moisturiser (simple) and I swear it really reduces my redness from acne. Like when I wake up they're definitely paler. My skin has certainly improved since I started using but I can't say for certain if it's helping my acne (I'm also using sulphur soap and epiduo so it could also be those starting to finally work).,1,1,0
I have had this purplish/red spot smack dab on my nose for about a month! The pic doesnt really do it justice - it really is quite red and angry looking. It started as a painful cyst that never came to a head yet stopped hurting after 3 days! I was left with a red bump that has gradually flattened out as layers are peeling off, but the redness remains. I can see a few flecks of white inside there so it may not be dead after all. I have no idea if it's a scar or not. At my disposal are: Neosporin, Mederma Scar, and Hydrocortisone. Or do nothing. Please help!!! Thank you  ,2,2,0
Could be PIE (damaged capillaries). 

Apply some pressure on the red mark. Does it temporarily turn lighter or fade? Then it's indeed PIE and you might need a vascular laser treatment. ,2,2,0

Putting heat on it always helps me.,2,2,0

That looks like a blister! Did you burn your nose? ,1,1,0
When I got shoulder/backne it was from working out and not showering immediately. The sweat would dry on my skin and make me break out something fierce. Use toner on a cotton ball every night before bed (I have my SO help me with the parts I can't reach).,7,7,0
I had that like your back acne. I believe my hot un breathable bed and pillows causes this. I tried sleeping on cool pad or on the floor to cool down my back. Now, I don't have a reoccurring back acne. Check your bed if it's warmup or trapping heat at your back. Let me know ,1,1,0
Try a sulfur bar soap while you shower. It's very inexpensive on Amazon and I believe you can find it in most drugstores. I love sulfur as an acne treatment. It doesn't smell the best, but you get used to it.,1,1,0
Did you switch shampoo or conditioner recently? Check if you have dandruff as that can cause back and shoulder acne too.
One more reason could be your laundry detergent or fabric softener,1,1,0

Be sure to moisturize after cleansing your face or it will dry up and give you more acne. Find an oil free face moisturizer if you dont already use it. I promise improvement!,6,6,0
At this point I'd recommend going to a derm, especially if the breakout was sudden. They might give you some retinoids or antibiotics or something to help. ,3,3,0
Please go to a dermatologist antibiotics work wonders and even better, acutane,2,2,0

Honestly never let that get to you. You deserve respect just as much as anyone else. The fact that you muster up the courage to go into work, whilst feeling self conscious, shows you are a strong person. Acne is completely normal and even though we may not want it, it's a natural condition that the majority of people get. When she asked "what's wrong with your face" you should've just replied with "nothing" because acne is completely normal, natural, and it's understandable to have it. So therefore nothing is wrong with your face. Don't let that shit get to you. Fuck em I say. Or as j cole says "fuck em all, they don't know all the pain I felt". Stay strong, one day this will all be over and will seem like such a minor worry and minor part of our lives! We got you fam <3,17,17,0
Talk to HR. That was very inappropriate for her to ask,11,11,0
"I have acne. What's wrong with yours?",8,8,0
Oh I feel you. I have had strangers come up to me and suggest remedies...as if I havent tried them all.    

The acne doesnt lessen who you are or what you can offer as a perso. so fuck it. You are doing whats needed to fix it. Forget what others think and shrug off such insensitive comments.  ,5,5,0
Happened to me to OP. I know the pain. It traumatized me and I avoided looking at mirrors for a while. I felt better when I didn't see my reflection. That was three years ago. It has gotten better now and I feel more confident in my skin. I feel for you because I know how hard it is to live with severe acne. It'll get better :) ,2,2,0
I once had someone ask me why I don't wash my face üòû,2,2,0
That's really hurtful, I'm really sorry :(   People used to say things like that to me and it really hurt. It's really true it says more about her and less about you. Honestly, I know you probably don't want to make it a big deal, but you could definitely go to HR, it was so awful of her to say that. I'm sorry  :( ,1,1,0
yes i also face the same thing. my friend started asking what happened to my face. all i say is i dont know. from that day i started to take good care of my face. doin what can i do to save it. i dont say i have clear skin now bcs i still have pih goin on. but please stay strong and surround urself with ppl that truly appreciate who u are. ignore those ppl who bring ur confidence down.,1,1,0
No problem try it if that doesn't work ,1,1,0
Try Doublebase gel or ceraphil ,-2,-2,0
Yes I have as well. I actually bought a 4oz bottle of tea tree essential oil off amazon (https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0176S8E9C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and I've been putting it all over my face and it's been working really well. It causes a little irritation for the first few days but I find the benefits are worth it.,2,2,0
Yup I have. Worked amazing for me & I even use it for my new piercings. ,1,1,0
Honestly, just go to the derm. It will be way safer than trusting us and you'll know what's going on immediately. Good luck!,2,2,0
Any pictures to give us a better idea of what you're dealing with? ,1,1,0

Try to use oil free cleanser,i use Clean & Clear blackhead clearing cleanser,apperently its for black heads but i use it regularly for my whole face,i clean my face with a really mild soap then dry it with a soft cloth and then put clean & clear,my acne is still visible but compared to what it was i am happy.Im 19 btw.Hope i helped!,1,1,0

I had very noticeable acne when I tried proactive and it worked great. I used it every other night and it reduced the majority of my zits/pimples and bumps for about six months of use. That being said, my acne cleared up for about a month but then returned:/ when I started using it again, my face would be swollen and itchy the next two days (I used Benadryl to calm it down). After the swelling went down my skin would be clear and I would tell myself that it was all worth it. Being the idiot I am, I used it twice more and the swelling got worse with each use, I now no longer use it and just use the Origins brand skincare products. It doesn't clear up my acne completely but it is much more worth it than face swelling. This is just my experience with proactive and I'm sure there are people with much more positive experiences.,2,2,0
I also quit eating/drinking stuff that has high amounts of sugar and caffeine that helped. About 7 months ago I quit drinking sodas and just drank water and my face cleared up instantly then I got back bad of drinking sugary stuff, started breaking out again then I got back on drinking straight water but it didnt work really at all so then I started taking vitamins and stuff but im not gonna say it cleared my acne up all the way (dont wanna speak to soon, and it start breaking out again) i also had chin acne like you pretty bad ,3,3,0
Vitamins,1,1,0
Not Moisturizing. I know it sounds strange, but don't moisturize over acne until that area has naturally healed. Everyone's skin is different, but I'm just sharing what worked for My skin. I have been experiment on my skin for 3 years and just recently I discovered that my acne will only heal if my skin is somewhat dry. 


Only if you have actual cracked skin or flaking or a condition such as eczema then go ahead moisturize, otherwise let your skin nourish itself.

You could try switching birth control if you believe it to be hormonal. I'm in the same boat where I'm on BC, but it's specifically for my acne. However, I'm most likely going to switch after giving it the 3 extra months my doctor recommended because my skin is clearer on my period üôÑ A lot of the time, the hormones in the birth control aren't at the right level for your individual skin, too much estrogen or progestin. ,2,2,0

I literally swear by aloe for this exact reason. If you can find a plant and just rip off a leaf from it, do that and dab the gel on it. It dries quickly, so I usually constantly re apply through out the day (best when you're at home doing nothing and don't have to be anywhere). I feel like it makes the skin heal at a super rate and form a scab quicker so it can ultimately peel off quicker. Which makes sense because aloe is supposed to have healing properties (think of when you put it on your sun burns). I'm currently using some now on a pimple scab and I'm confident it will be ready to come off in two days! ,2,2,0
Tree oil would help it heal a little bit faster yes but try to let it heal on it's on too of course do not pick it you have to let it heal and just let it stay on your face I know it might be hard but just like whiteheads I have I have to walk around with them but it's for the best good luck,1,1,0
Yes that works. remember to moisturize as well at end. too much AHA can cause overexfoliation,1,1,0
I was going for an all natural approach. I now have mild acne and no dry skin and it really radiates. I've been using Mad Hippies Vitamin A and C serum, I also use natural aloe vera like I cut off a piece of the plant and rub it on my face and it helps hydrate and heal. ,1,1,0
Is there any particular reason you want natural medicine over stuff made in a lab? ,1,1,0
I love Cetaphil & Simple cleansers. I usually alternate between them. 

Check out Era Organics moisturizer on Amazon. It's my favorite face cream.

You may want to use a light moisturizer. Gel moisturizers are pretty light and will dry fast so you won't feel like there is grease sitting on top of your face. You CAN use shea butter but YMMV. Same with jojoba oil. One tiny drop should be more than ok :),3,3,0
Perhaps the soap you are using is leaving a residue, causing the tight feeling? Hard to say as I'm unfamiliar with the soap. I have very oily skin and have had the hardest time finding an oil free moisturizer that I like. I've tried several through the years and recently started using Neutrogena Oil Free Hydro Boost Gel. I feel like it soaks into my skin really well and doesn't leave a residue or leave me shiny. It also has a cooling sensation, which is nice if you have irritated skin. You may try switching up your soap as well. My dermatologist once recommended Cetaphil to me. I've been using a natural shea butter soap I get from clearandsmooth.com for years. It's really hydrating, but does not leave a residue. They have a GREAT line of acne and skin care products. ,2,2,0
You might really benefit from derma rolling for those scars. ,1,1,0

I used to be on doxycycline. It worked for awhile (like about 3 months?) but then I took a six month break and resumed. It didn't work at all the second time. Bottom line is that it's a temporary solution. Now my skin is better like I'd get one or two zits but I have a lot of acne scars. I switched to tretinoin 0.5% and azelaic acid 1% and they've worked a charm. Also important to moisturise the skin. Drying lotion is also good for those juicy zits. ,1,1,0

This isn't an answer... but can you update on if the tea tree oil works? I've heard about it as a treatment but I'm too scared to put oil on my acned face. ,2,2,0
Really hope that works for you! I would suggest that you use something else to distribute the solution. The applicator provided could gut dirty with longterm use and then you would contaminate your face with every use.,2,2,0
First should be clindamycin, followed by tea tree (coz medication first). Remember to dilute it first with a carrier oil. High quality tea tree will burn your skin if used undiluted. ,1,1,0
What's your age? Once I hit late 20s and I'm now 32, diet change is the only thing that truly worked for me. Mine was diary, my husband's was soda. ,3,3,0
Things Im doing to prevent acne:

- Dont fully shave always trim to 1.5mm twice a week. This does actually help a little bit.

- Chance pillow casing every day.

- Deluted tea tree oil on spots. Not sure yet if this does anything at all.

- Vitamin E Face wash gel, once or twice a day.

- Using soap free, and Ph neutral shampoo (still contains sulfates). 

Things I tried and stopped doing:

- Differin or adapalene GEL (vitamin A gel) 1mg/g. This helped a little bit. But dried out 
my skin badly after a few months still leaving acne spots.

- clindamycin lotion 1% FNA. Did nothing, execpt dry out my skin.
,2,2,0
I'd say you have mild acne. Do you often have breakouts?
Im on my third month supply of IMMUNE Acne Treatment. It's a 30 day kit but it does a good job of managing my acne. Before that I was on acne treatments with Benzoyl Peroxide... yea not a fan of those. They dry your skin albeit they do fade it out a bit but really not worth it when you have better options. So things like Proactiv are really outdated but people dont realize that...
If you want something good then i'll highly recommend this one.

I'm 24, I have acne for 11 years,  after cutting off dairy from my diet and using fresh aloe gel from my garden it ended up my struggle with acne.  I tried everything, even accutane,  chemical peels,  expensive stuff,2,2,0
Not sure how many blades you're using to shave, but the less number of blades the better. I use two blade cartridges.

When is the last time you tried not using any products at all?,1,1,0
For shampoo, castile soap (I use Dr. Bronners) eliminated the acne I had on my head, chest, back, and some on my forehead. Still had acne on my face after that. Might be worth a try.

That Vitamin E face wash you're using looks kind of sketchy. It has a ton of ingredients in it. If you're looking to try something new look into a very light cleanser and use it only once a day. Any more than once a day will dry your face out and make it produce more oil. Any other time you need to wash your face try using just water.,1,1,0
Are you using any products with Salicylic Acid or Benzoyl peroxide? Also do they have white heads or are they just pink?,1,1,0
Its pretty hard to find the perfect salicylic acid formula in a product. Have you ever tried Neutrogena's Acne Oil Free Wash? 
,2,2,0
First off, if you only get breakouts in the those 2 places, I would not use any acne products anywhere else on your face.  This is pretty obvious and you probably already knew this, but just in case.  You don't want to cause problems where there aren't any.

Second, have you tried not shaving?  These seem like they could be plugged hair follicles turning into acne.  If you don't get them when you stop shaving, that's probably the culprit.

Third, how long did you try the retin-a / clindamycin combo?  These are really strong prescriptions and when used together should almost always clear up mild cases of acne.  However, if you haven't stuck to using them for at least a couple months, you can't really determine whether or not they are working.  How did your doctor tell you to use them?,1,1,0
Yeah it's fucks the Ph of your skin ,4,4,0
It burned my skin!  Even if its diluted with water. ,2,2,0
My BC has caused HORRIBLE Adult ance so  I started washing once a day and rubbing it on my face with a cotton ball once a day before bed and its almost 100% gone. I highly recommend it. ,2,2,0
No if anything your skin will get more red bc ur PH is thrown off and therefore ur skin is irritated. Do not use homemade dumb Pinterest remedies, go see a professional. ,3,3,0
Idk about rubbing it (sounds abrasive and irritating), but using a 1:1 mixture of ORGANIC apple cider vinegar and water (I put it on lightly using a cotton pad) actually has healed 95% of my acne (I've been using it for two months as a toner), when nothing else was working before for me! It regulates the pH of the skin I've read; it really amazed me how good it was for my skin.,4,4,0
May be too abrasive for your skin because of the high acidity!! I use it with the Aztec Clay mask. ,2,2,0
Works well for some people. Dilute it 1/4-1/2. ,1,1,0
First I want to say, you have really nice skin! And you shouldn't be embarrassed. I don't know what you have, but you shouldn't feel uncomfortable about it. You could easily cover it with some concealer, if you want to go that route. Again, I don't know what you have exactly, so I don't know how you'd treat it. But still, it's not a big deal at all. ,7,7,0
Buy some bare minerals! It's super light, I can send you a link and help you pick out correct stuff if you need help. I specifically recommend bare minerals because it is virtually impossible to mess up putting on. Watch some YouTube videos on it and you will see what I mean. Good luck! ,3,3,0

Hey twin. 

This is called PIE. Unfortunately there is no cure for this other than laser treatment. Even I haven't got a treatment yet but I can tell you that this issue is related to your blood vessels from the looks of it. 

I suggest you research PIE VS PIH and maybe do a touch test to find out which one you have on your nose just to make sure. ,1,1,0
My acne was actually worse when i was a vegetarian. But i dont really eat much red meat anyway,5,5,0
Currently on it rn and i'm 9 weeks in. Everyone has a different experience with side effects but what i've heard from my friends, it is so worth it. For me though, i had a horrible initial breakout but i am finally starting to clear now. No bad side effects at all. And i was like you where my skin fluctuates but i bit the bullet when it started to get bad again after being somewhat good for a while,1,1,0
Thanks! And yes ofcourse a looot of ppl get a late initial breakout. Everyone's reaction is different!,1,1,0
If you are given the option to start it then take it. It helps even if you have minor acne to severe. But it's a whole course, so mentally prepare yourself for up to 3-4 months of possible ups and downs with your skin. Be patient with it and you'll be clear. 

I personally am lucky enough to just walk in to any pharmacy and grab a dose of Accutane without a prescription for less than $30, but for the sake of it I took a blood test and got a positive result for Accutane eligibility. ,1,1,0
Your skin may be purging. Have you used any other cleansers before?,1,1,0
What do you eat on a daily basis?,5,5,0
I'd happily do this, the issue is I hit the gym 5 days a week so don't know how I would hit my macros ,2,2,0
What's your diet like? As soon as I cut out dairy, processed sugars, gluten and eggs I noticed 90% of my closed comedones (and other acne) disappear within 2 months! I'm still new to this diet and I'm eventually going to try to work a few of these back in in moderation because it's pretty restrictive, but for now I'm so happy my skin finally cleared up to mind! ,2,2,0
You could also try adding a retinoid into your routine. I've been using differin gel for a few months and it's helped to get rid of a lot of stubborn closed comedones I had on my forehead and PIH I had from cystic acne ,2,2,0
Do you have any active acne? If it's mostly scarring, I suggest you go to the dermatologist and look into laser removal for your scars. If that's too expensive I've heard great things about micro dermabrasion. They're little rollers you can buy from many various sites (banish is the most famous) for like $30-$60 and that should help reduce the scarring. Good luck! But seriously...talk to a derm before you do anything ,1,1,0

 I went on antibiotics for 6 months and it helped my acne but I still have some, I might go on some form of acne treatment again but I just use topical creams now. Even though it helped me everyone is different so know that before going into it:),2,2,0
They work by killing the bacteria that causes acne so once you go off it, it is very likely to return. ,2,2,0
Yes they work both by killing the bacteria and have some anti-inflammatory effects. However, these arent really a cure. Depending on how severe your acne is, it can work really well but once you stop taking them, your acne will come back. Your doctor might also not want you to be on them for too long because you might you might develop resistance to the antibiotics which can suck if you need them for an actual infection. ,1,1,0
They have antibiotic creams you can talk to your doctor about I believe. Those are probably less likely to mess with your system.,1,1,0
I had it done and it didn't hurt! ,3,3,0
I had one removed from the back of my neck and didn't hurt at all.,1,1,0
I'm 24 and certain alcoholic beverages do break me out. Mostly, it dehydrates you, which creates littttleee cracks in your skin enabling bacteria to sneak in. Sexy, right? 

Dairy is somewhat controversial, but a lot of people think that the mass produced, non organic overall poor quality of dairy we consume increases se run production making your skin oily and therefore acne-ey. 

I've also noticed when I go on carb overload my body is just like FUCK YOU and throws some zits on my face. ,1,1,0
Same. Especially sweet alcohol. I found that drinking a glass of water every 15-30 mins while drinking alcohol helps. You don't have a headache in the morning too lol.,1,1,0
First test if it's PIE or PIH. Put some pressure on the red marks, if they dissappear or turn lighter, it's PIE. If it stays the same, it's PIH. 
After that find out the different treatment options for either. You may consider a laser treatment. ,1,1,0
You can try using something with hydro quinolone in it which will lighten the spots over time. ,1,1,0
Hey there! I also used to struggle with chest and back acne but it cleared up as soon as I started using head and shoulders classic shampoo. I never struggled with any facial acne but had pretty severe back acne as a teen until my early 20s. I read online that using head and shoulders several times a week may help. I was super skeptical but decided why not and started using it regularly. After the third time my back acne cleared up so well! Only issue is it can dry out your skin severely so don't use it everyday and on off days just rinse with water. Avoid using regular body wash on your back and chest. Hope it works well for you!,2,2,0
I used to have major problems with bacne.    Like I showed my doctor and he said it was a 8/10 and suggested I get on accutane straight away. However, I was always weary and hadn't tried any other method first. So I tried 5% benzoyl peroxide, I think the actual cream is called acnecide. 

In 6 months it had almost completely cleared my back. All I did was  put it over my back and let it soak in for 10-20 minutes before I went to bed each night.

It's definitely not nice when you first start doing it, it would really dry my skin and it even burned my skin when I applied too much but I noticed it looked like it was working so I persevered. 

It took about 3-4 months for the spots to go and another 3 months for any redness or scars to fade. So it's not a quick fix. I think it works by killing the bacteria on the skin but not your current spots, so it's a case of keep applying the cream and waiting for any current spots to work themselves out of your system which is why it's not an over night fix. 

I would definitely recommend it, if the cause of your acne isn't hormonal. ,1,1,0
I've struggled with it since having my first child four years ago. Someone told me once when I was feeling down on myself that people aren't looking at my skin, they're looking at me and I am beautiful. Hold the same mindset for yourself. Your skin doesn't define who you are, your personality does. ,6,6,0
Yeah it's too demotivating... It's too hard to walk out bare face can totally connect with u as even m fighting the losing battle since 6 years... :( 
Even if we wana feel confident in our own skin people stare in such a weird way n make us realise that they'z something wrong with us like we are 'aliens'.. ,2,2,0
What's your accutane dosage? I was still getting breakouts and they upped my dosage from 40 mg to 60 mg and I was dry as hell but it FINALLY worked.  I've heard of people being on doses as high as 120 even. 

Don't stop looking for solutions. You're is out there, and when you finally have clear skin it will be SO worth it!,1,1,0
Keep trying to figure out what is causing it. 

I had some sort of contradictory reaction to accutane and ended up with the worst acne Ive ever seen. All the dermatologists had no idea what was going on (they even wanted me to attend a regional dermatogoly clinic so all the best people in the area could observe me and bounce ideas off each other) 

They were of no help, but eventually I solved it through researching on the internet and with the help of a naturopath. (Its a really long and complicated story)

Anyway now that my skin is clear for the first time in years I feel amazing, its odd how much better you feel when you get clear skin, all just because your more confident and happy with yourself. 

So keep on lookin for answers, the reward once you find out is even better than I imagined.

,1,1,0
I had this type if acne for years! The white bumps were closed comedones - so lots of clogged pores.

I switched to salycilic acid cleanser (Neutrogena grapefruit cleanser) and organic hemp seed oil as a moisturizer. Also use the Neutrogena benzoyl peroxide rapid clear spot treatment. I keep it very simple and stopped touching my face/popping/picking. 

Took about a year coupled with some diet changes and my skin is basically completely clear. After 7 years it feels amazing.

Good luck to you and keep trying until you find a routine that works! (Also give a new routine time to work at least two weeks before switching to something else)

All the red ones are flat and then I have lots of white bumps under the skin ,2,2,0
Sorry to hijack a bit but I have the same problem so I wanna follow this post!,2,2,0
Any past or current products that you are using/used?,2,2,0
Your prescription cream should help a lot. Try use an oil free cleanser though - my dermatologist explained it would take my skin longer to clear if I kept using products with that had oil.,1,1,0
Hi, I still struggle with Acne, however most of my smaller comedones have gone away for the most part. Exfoliation is key to not only lift away dead skin cells, but also deep clean the skin. Manual exfoliation isn't good for acne-prone skin. AHA/BHA's are really good for getting rid of the comedones. I use the COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid (Its not only for Whiteheads, COSRX's titles can sometimes be a little misleading, but not in a bad way). Its not super acidic and abrasive as many american skincare products. It may be pricy but has majorly improved the texture and acne on my skin. If you decide to buy the COSRX AHA use it after your toner and let it sit on your skin for about 15-20 minutes to balance out your PH. Once thats done apply your moisturizers or continue with you regular routine!,1,1,0
This looks so similar to the acne I used to have, but mine were much bigger in size. Whatever you do DON'T attempt to pop or squeeze them, I always thought my skin was invincible still being a teen and now I'm left with some nasty scars. I did just start using differin gel though, it's only been 5 days but I'm hoping this clears up the majority of my acne + skin texture.,1,1,0
Everything else I use (make up, moisturizer etc.) is oil free. However I use the gentle cetaphil cleanser which isn't strictly oil free. Because I was in such a high dose of accutane, all of the oil free foams were too drying.,1,1,0
If you say it's down to humidity, perhaps it dried then up? I know cheap soaps can be quite drying ,2,2,0
It won't bleach your skin but it will bleach your pillow cover or any other fabrics that comes into contact with your skin when you put on BP.,3,3,0
The best thing is that they have peroxide resistant sheets and pillows :),2,2,0
My holy grail is a mask of 
Bentonite clay + activated charcoal + honey + ACV 

I used to get terrible breakouts, even cystic acne, & now they're manageable. I still have no clue how this mask helped my cystic acne - by every definition of cystic acne, nothing on the surface is supposed to help it, but it did. 

I'm not questioning it. Just going with it. ,1,1,0
I always go perscription, s/he will most likely give you something with Benzoyl Peroxide. For now though, get something with Salicylic Acid and wash with Black African Soap.,1,1,0
If your face is oily, you can use just bentonite clay by itself as well. I find it too drying for my combination skin. The honey helps keep the balance for me. ,1,1,0
Exfoliating definitely made my skin worst. You seem like you have sensitive skin, let me tell you something that might sound a bit crazy. You may be using *too many* products on your face. My routine was very similar to yours after I experienced a bad breakout and piling the products made it worse, but I was too scared to change my routine since I thought my skin would behave badly. Let me start off my pointing out the flaws in your routine. A toner is used to add more acidity to your face after using an alkaline cleanser, to balance out the ph of your face, but as you said your cleanser is ph balanced already. So your face might be too acidic. If you need witch hazel you can incorporate it into a gentle cleanser that has it or a moisturizer, or use a witch hazel mask if you NEED witch hazel. Cleanse your face, you can use BP but you're already using salicylic acid AND the differin so you may be using too many medicated products (which can irritate your face even more!) Moisturizer and sunscreen, and if you need a great concealer that won't break you out I recommend using Tarte Shape Tape concealer at Ulta OR find a concealer you like and look it up on cosdna.com, this website determines how comedogenic or acnegenic your makeup is. Research and invest your invest in your makeup. (You can also use a concealer that has salicylic acid.) A flaw in your night routine is mixing salicylic acid and differin. The oxy pads have salicylic acid, which is known to weaken the 0.1% adapalene. Adapalene is the active ingredient in differin. If I were you I'd remove the makeup with micellar water, cleanse with a GENTLE non-comedogenic cleanser, apply moisturizer with hylauranic acid WHILE your face is slightly damp so the water molecules will be introduced into your skin cells, wait for your face to dry, apply differin. Differin is EXTREMELY effective but it takes weeks to months for it to see results. Couple weeks in you will have a breakout and you'd want to give up but don't, this is normal with differin. Differin will loosen your pores so the gunk will be easier to break down so it is more prone to bacteria, so be careful. And RESIST THE URGE TO SCRUB YOUR FACE! Differin can be used with BP. You may want to look into the neutrogenia rapid clear leave on mask, I have had great results and I'm wearing on my face right now, AND  you can wear it under makeup!!! So you don't have to worry about the makeup breaking you out. Good luck, if all else fails go see an esthetician or dermatologist. Edit: Epiduo is basically adapalene and benzoyl peroxide so you can combine Differin and the leave on mask for maximum effectiveness. For BP you only need 2.5%, it is as effective as 10% minus the irritation.,3,3,0
Posted in this sub before and feel like I'm losing progress as acne is getting worse. 

In the morning 
Cleanse my face with a pH balanced cleanser
Tone with witch hazel
Use benzoyl peroxide 
Moisturize with Cetaphil
Zinc oxide sunscreen 
Then I put on makeup because it's gotten so bad (I know it's bad but can't help it)

At night 
Wash off makeup and cleanse skin with Oxy pads
Then same as morning without sunscreen
Apply differin 

In the past I've used Vitamin C and used scar creams, I've taken Zinc and probiotics but none of it has helped 
I've cut out dairy, went low glycemic, tried just about every remedy in the book. Even invested in an exfoliating rotating brush that I think makes it worse. 
My acne is moving down to my lower cheeks, which can mean poor dental hygiene with I've been vigilant of. 

Edit: 19/ Male ,1,1,0
* I do not recommend putting on makeup, I know it's bad, but you might have to deal with it. The makeup clogs the pores even more.

* I see that you are using Differin, what does your Dr. say about it? Have you tried Epiduo or Clindamycin?



* Also, acne on lower cheeks doesn't really lead to poor dental hygiene, just go slower and more cautiously. ,1,1,0
How long have you been using the differin gel? It seems most of the times people who start using it get bigger break outs than they've ever had before, but after a month or two they should start to calm down.,1,1,0
No correlation between cold water and acne.,9,9,0
I use cold cos hot water strips off the skin's moisture. ,3,3,0
Cold showers reduced my inflammation by more than 80%. One of the best changed I made in the last few months.,3,3,0
I use cold water because ice/cold water always reduces the inflammation, and makes me feel more refreshed and cleaner! But there are no correlations.,2,2,0
I heard washing your face in a hot shower can break capillaries and opens your pores so yeah cold shower is the best for washing your face dont believe me? Look up on google if its safe to wash your face in the shower,2,2,0

https://m.imgur.com/a/r84bL I have been struggling with an acne problem ever since getting the depo shot 4 months ago. mostly just cystic acne in a few spots. I went to see a dermatologist, he put me on doxycycline 100 mg 2 times a day. ive been on that for 2 1/2 months now. I was clearing up until a few weeks ago these little pimples started popping up and theyve spread all over my face. i thought they were closed comedones but now i dont know. my derm says its just my acne being stubborn but ive never had this kind of acne before, its getting worse and looks almost like a rash to me maybe even fungal acne? i cant get on accutane. i started using witch hazel but it seems to irritate it more. What do you think the problem is? What can i do to get rid of it?,1,1,0
What about a mild allergic reaction? Have you eaten anything new? ,1,1,0
It was the first antibiotic I was put on. It really wasn't that effective, which made my dermatologist put me on Accutane. But no, it didn't break me out. ,3,3,0
Not really, but it can be different for everyone.,1,1,0

I vote for ringworm. I had it on my neck once as a kid, looked just like this. Hope you're able to get help :(,6,6,0
fungal! i had this before due to pet allergy get blood tested.,1,1,0
Hey, I have something similar that just comes and goes! I have no clue what it is. It's been tested as cold sore (it's not), we tried anti Fungal (its not fungal), tried betadine (did nothing), and the only thing that seemed to work was bactroban, and that only makes it go away when it comes up, it doesn't get rid of it forever. Please go see a doctor and if anti fungal treatment doesn't work, ask to try bactroban. Let us know how it goes as I am very interested!,1,1,0
Also thought ringworm...see a doctor.,1,1,0
Ringworm?  
Lymes disease tick bites leave rings like that, too.,1,1,0
Head and shoulders is antifungal, try washing your face with it. Sounds weird but dandruff is actually from yeast growth in the scalp and yeast is fungus just like ringworm. Head and shoulders and tinactin has cleared my ringworm in the past.,-1,-1,0

I had exactly the same type of acne in the same place at your age. I went ok doxycycline which worked for a year and then minocycline which works for about another year. Before those though maybe try taking vitamin A supplements and see how that goes, don't over do it though because you will poison your liver, and that is worth a lot more than acne. ,1,1,0
I would try cutting out dairy, caffeine and sugar and see if you notice a difference. Maybe even try giving up fruit too since most fruit contains a lot of sugar also,1,1,0
That is totally fine.,2,2,0
Did you use a moisturizer after cleansing your face? ,2,2,0
You can try qv cream.. I am using it. ,1,1,0
I've been using a different cleanser in the morning and before bed for years to get two different benefits. Works for me! :),1,1,0
Try vitamin C it has been working for my hyper pigmentation. I occasionally put some aloe vera too the clear kind and it refreshes and heals. ,1,1,0
If it's a moderate to severe case of discoloration and pigmentation, then it's much more efficient and wise to get a laser treatment. If it's minor, stick to a gentle skincare routine and wear sunscreen when needed. ,1,1,0
I heard about lemon juice too but I have been too scared to try it since if you are near sunlight it will burn and leave permanent scars so I don't want to take that risk,1,1,0
I use vitamin e moisturizing sticks for mine,1,1,0
I dont understand why she would recommend against using a moisturizer,,if you are using a non comedogenic one..you should be perfectly fine and your comfort always comes first.,3,3,0
Maybe she was saying that because she didn't want you to dilute the tretinoin.

I wash my face, wait til it's dry, then apply a thin layer of tretinoin. Then I let that dry and add a layer of non comedogenic moisturizer. My skin still gets to absorb the tretinoin, and it's also moisturized.,1,1,0
I rarely use a moisturizer; they always seem to clog my pores and make my skin worse. Maybe you can try pure aloe vera gel or a rose water spray to help with the dehydration.,1,1,0
Well, I feel like she wants your face to be dry and flaky! It is supposed to do that!



But I do hear Moisturizing is really good for skin. I can't help you with this question :P,1,1,0
I have used them on a pimple I did not think would come to a head for a long time and when I woke up in the morning it had formed a head. ,1,1,0

Benzoyl peroxide tends to make the skin red, dry, and flaky. Try continuing the use of it but put less of what you usually use so your face can adjust to it. If it's still persistent after a week then I'd suggest you stop.,1,1,0
I think proactive is good. It definitely has a lot of benefits, but not all skincare products are enough to use alone. Using an additional moisturizer is a good idea if you think the proactiv is drying out your skin too much.  I'd probably use a really rich moisturizer at night, and then the next night use the proactiv so you get the benefits of both products. I just looked at proactiv's website and saw this page about dry skin and which products are best https://www.proactiv.com/en_us/skin-types-acne/dry-skin.html
Maybe you can check the proactiv reviews page http://www.proactiv.com/en_us/proactiv-reviews.html and see if anyone else talks about having dry skin and if proactiv works for them.,1,1,0
I've tried using numerous skin-care products but none helped ( actually most of them, worsened my case or made my skin peel ). I also sometimes have acne on other parts of my face but those leave very quickly. ,1,1,0
A dermatologist is a place to go! Your skin will normally peel with treatment. Also, it looks like you are wearing gel, make sure to clean off your face when you wear it. I feel like this has something to do with having small hair (like me) on your face. 



Doctor will give you a good treatment :),1,1,0
PLease be very careful with topical steroids. Go to itsan.org for more information about topical steroid withdrawal. It is very dangerous to put on the face because of high absorbtion rate, and many people's skin gets addicted and the withdrawal is long and hard journey. ,3,3,0
I had a rash on my face last year and I went into my general doctor to get referred to a dermatologist and she instead gave me some cortisone. This got rid of the rash but left my acne worse than it had been for years. In doing some research I also read that bc it's a steroid your skin gets used to it and eventually you'd have to increase the percentage. There's also some studies that show it can lead to extreme signs of aging. I immediately stopped using. So just be cautious using it. ,2,2,0
I just finished my 7th month with the same exact dosage as you (continuing 120mg through the 7th month) and my acne didn't clear up completely until the end of month 5/going into month 6. It will get there I promise! I was losing hope too. It sucks and it's hard not seeing the improvement you want but you just need to stick it out. I hope that helps. You got this!,3,3,0
Accutane is powerful stuff, give it time to work its magic. You can help it out by drinking plenty of water, eating veggies and no dairy or added sugar.,2,2,0
I was on Accutane for 1 year! That is how long it took for me to get clear!! I had to just power through school with my face with giant cysts. Now I have clearer faces than most of the kids at school! haha


Don't worry about it too much, and just let Accutane do its job :P,2,2,0
I'm finally seeing results after 8 months when I told it would be 6, you might need a higher dose like me!,1,1,0
I didn't clear up until the end of my fifth month. Don't get too discouraged it will eventually get clear!,1,1,0
I'm not familiar with those medications, but what acne stuff often does is it turns your skin over faster so it brings everything, including acne, that's under your skin to the surface. They call it a Purge. Hopefully it clears up in the next couple weeks. I'm going through the same thing. ,12,12,0
Purging, dear. Give it 3-4 months before you decided if it worked or didn't work. 

I just hit month 4 on tretinoin and an antibiotic. My skin looked like yours  (see my post history) and it's only in the last two weeks that it started reslly healing.

Do the routine 3-4 months before making a judgement on it's effectiveness.,4,4,0
Give it more time. Treatment can often result in a flair up of acne in the first few weeks or even months. That's how it was for my friend when he was on acutane.,2,2,0
Doxy always brought everything to the surface for me, and then everything cleared up in two months or so. Stick with it,1,1,0
Sorry to tell you OP, but tret does have a rather long purging phase (months) so I would stick it out, but if you really are unhappy you could quit. You've made it this far, I would keep going.,1,1,0
Stick with it! I went through the tretinoin purge too and was so upset that I quit after a couple months. My dermatologist put me back on tretinoin at a higher dose and I had the worst breakout I've ever had... it got worse but I stuck with it and then suddenly it got better. Now I only have 2 closed comedones (whiteheads) and some PIH. The PIH is clearing up slowly but surely with azelaic acid and continued tretinoin use. So worth going through the crappy breakout phase.,1,1,0
Usually you should give it some time, it always starts off to look really bad (even with accutane) then cools down and gets better,1,1,0
Perioral dermatitis maybe. Or just a damaged moisturize barrier because of the area. I would try using some aquaphor to protect the area. ,2,2,0
I sympathise with the struggle. I don't want to know how much money ive spent on acne "solutions" that didnt even work. I was able to clear up my whole face by cutting out sugar, all dairy, and refined carbs. Cardio helped fade it quicker. I know the idea of a diet that restrictive is a bit spooky especially if you love food as much as I do. However, its definitely been worth it IMO. "Nothing tastes as good as clear skin feels.",6,6,0
I want to second this. I had pretty bad acne for about 10 years before I went on the keto diet (very very low carb). I went on the diet to lose weight, and although I didn't lose much weight (my partner lost 20 lbs, so it works for some), it cleared up my acne completely. At first I'd still get some spots, but they were so much smaller and less inflamed, then they went away all together. I was on keto for about 3-4 months before I gave up. Knock on wood, but so far it hasn't come back unless I eat something I know will trigger it (for me, soy and shrimp cause cystic breakouts, so I avoid them still). If you've tried everything else, give it a shot.,1,1,0
You can do keto without losing weight, just up the protein and fat while keeping carbs very low. I'm pretty skinny too and lost like... 2 lbs over 4 months.,1,1,0
Hey, all. I have that in my ear. I make music for a living, so I would like to be safe rather than sorry. I'm not prone to acne, but I think my headphone cleaning needs some work. I am concerned that I might get an ear infection or that the pimple is already infected. I'm not even able to clean my ear, or it might pop. Do I need to see a doctor for antibiotics or something? Any other advice is appreciated (besides popping it). ,1,1,0
May aswell see a doctor, it can't hurt. They'll probably just lance it and drain it though.,1,1,0

Going dairy free and little sugar works well for some (most) people, but just ensure you have a calcium alternative for when you go dairy free. Just make sure not to pick it, as acne can leave in a few weeks, but scars can last months. ,11,11,0
I would recommend giving yourself a good facial, something with clay or mud to dry some of the surface oil up. Follow that up with either a plain honey on your face for about 15 minutes (honey is naturally antibacterial and is also very moisturizing and healing to the skin) and/or a sheet mask that is for brightening or detoxing. After the face masks, use an alcohol based toner (I love dickensons witch hazel- I've had to deal with acne since I was your age and I am a full grown adult not but this stuff works). If you have an acne control serum or lotion, use that (clean and clear has a cheap one I think, but it might not be great for long term use if you have sensitive skin. ALWAYS use a moisturizer, day or night no matter what your skin type. Acne products can be very drying to skin and your skin is a part of your body that really needs hydration and special care. 

If you wear makeup I would recommend a BB cream or tiny instead of a full cover foundation, so that your skin can breath. Use a concealer and green color correction concealer if you think you need it. But the most important thing to remember is that everyone breaks out, especially when they are a young teenager. I promise 95% of people you know are dealing with it too. Ask your parents if you can see a dermatologist if you think you need more help. And try not to stress too much about school! :) ,6,6,0
So, I did make sure I was old enough to have a reddit account before I posted this. I've already spot treated the two shiners but I'm not sure that they'll clear up before Monday and I really try not to pop mine for fear of scarring. Anyways, I'm just really nervous about my acne. I've had it since 6th grade and my face is relatively clear (lol I know) right now but I've only started caring about it now. I'm sort of overweight and it just makes me think I look gross. I was just wondering if you guys had any products you could recommend for me. I've tried salicylic acid all summer but it didn't do much. Maybe I need to up the percentage of it (im using 2 percent right now) and I use benzoyl peroxide for the spots like the two shiny ones on my forehead. I'm just tired of having acne and I sorta want help picking out a product. Thank you in advance if anyone is actually going to reply to this. 



Edit: Sorry for no name brands, lol. I use Clearasil Rapid Action Pads made with the salicylic acid and I use some generic Walgreens brand acne spot treatment that's made with benzoyl peroxide. ,2,2,0
Get some sun block for your face! The earlier you start taking care of your skin the more you'll appreciate when you're older. ,2,2,0
CosRx pimple master patches for active breakouts. Dunno if you can get them in a store or if someone can recommend a drugstore alternative.  They're not magic to make things disappear overnight (mostly) but they keep things manageable with make up. 

Scars won't go away in 2 days but try vitamin C serums for the scars. Give it a few weeks before it works. 

Like the others said give yourself a good facial so that you skin is in the best shape to take a bit make up. Don't go full coverage make up. It might look good in the mirror but in the daylight over the entire day it will start looking gross. ,1,1,0
I've been dealing with acne since I was our age too and the thing I wish someone had told me (and tbh I only just worked it in the past three years) is that you must not overtreat your face and pimples. Using too many drying products just aggravates it! So avoid alcohol-based products, avoid using more than one 'active' acne ingredient at a time and really really use a good moisturiser (that's also good for acne-prone skin so no thick, creamy ones). ,1,1,0
Clean up your diet and cut out all sugars and dairy. No more milk but it's for the best. Eat tons of greens too. I usually blend all my greens and chug it which makes it so much easier than chewing it. Seriously get used to eating healthier, I didn't start seriously until my junior year of highschool and I regret not getting in the habit of denying junk food. Nothing will happen within a week, your acne will start showing results within a month or two. ,1,1,0
Have you asked your parents to take you to a dermatologist yet? I know 8th grade is a tough time to be dealing with something like this.

ETA: also you said you're overweight. I don't think that that necessarily correlates to skin but I can say as a fit person who has bad skin.... being in really good shape gives me a lot more confidence even when my skin is gross. For some reason despite my skin, I have no problems dating and making friends. I think that's due in large part to being in very good shape. The only complaint anyone could make about my appearance right now is my skin. Yes that's a bit shallow but it's also how the world is. Sometimes going for a long jog helps me forget about how ugly I think my skin is.,1,1,0
Honestly when I was in eighth grade I had acne like yours. All these different treatments from the dermatologists didn't work so I started trying other products that beauty reviewers recommended online. Those were a flop too. The only thing that really made a difference was getting pore extractions and facial treatments. The clinics cne clearing gel helped prevent small acne but really the facial pore extractions helped prevent the large amount of breakouts I had. ,1,1,0
I had terrible acne growing up and into my late 20s. What really worked for me was going a natural route, it changed my skin like magic!  Make sure you wash your face every morning and night and avoid touching your face with your hands unless it's necessary. I was amazed at the difference that made on my skin. Essential oils, mainly Tea tree oil, made a huge impact on my skin also.  Pay attention to the makeup you use, avoid anything that is comedogenic. I know how frustrating it is, but Don't let yourself get stressed out. ,1,1,0
Don't worry, when I went into the 8th grade I had it even worse!! Yours isn't that bad, believe me, it isn't! Make sure to visit a dermatologist and they will always try to help!,1,1,0
You're very oily so you need to use AND STICK TO products that control your oil. For your acne I would suggest going to a derm. My *unprofessional op is to use a benzoyl peroxide cleanser, cleanse your skin with this for one min morning and night. Use a SA and Or GA toner once a day and use clidmycin and retin-a, you will need a script for these. 

If you do not have insurance/can't see a derm for whatever reason look into proactive or acne.com's multi step pack. ,1,1,0

Have you explored whether it might be fungal folliculitis? I had a persistent forehead breakout for ~3 months and it only went away when I started treating it as fungal. I suggest that because I've heard antibiotics can make fungal acne worse.,1,1,0
Unfortunately, this often happens after Accutane. Consult your dermatologist. I've heard that a second round of Accutane can really get rid of acne for good, but this is sadly common. ,1,1,0
Sorry you have cystic acne. I can relate to the feelings of social isolation it can cause. It's painful and annoying. 

Have you had your hormone levels checked? Any blood work? Have you considered Accutane? Are you male or female? ,1,1,0
Find out if your dermatologist does injections for cysts. Maybe they can fit you in right away. It helps the cysts go down faster. ,1,1,0
Consult a dermatologist.

Try Aldactone/Spironolactone. It's a diuretic and has left me with virtually no symptoms and clear skin. I tried Accutane and it never worked, along with antibiotics, creams, and cleaners. Spironolactone changed my life.
,4,4,0
Have you talked to a dermatlogist yet? I would recommend looking up accutane. It is a pretty serious drug but that's best shot for a permanent cure. I see you have some scarring (the pits and indents) going on too. I would highly recommend seeing a derm, and please please don't pop your acne - that will result in more pits and dents and unfortunately those are permanent and hard/very expensive to fix.,2,2,0
BC and spironolactone are what I'd recommend for hormonal acne. They've made the most improvement in my skin and coupled with azelaic acid and retin-A I'm making amazing progress. It took some patience and letting go of worrying too much about it and now all I have is PIH.,2,2,0
I'm 19 female. So I've dealt with acne for about 3-4 years now and I've tried numerous products over the counter and prescribed and I can't get away from it. My dermatologist told me I just have hormonal acne. I've seen YouTube videos and people saying they have all these types of acne and kinda would like to see if anyone knows what type of acne I have and what would help it medical or natural. Pleaseee and thankyouu its real hard for me to post pictures but here they are. 

Used many topical ointments and cetephil for face wash. 
Currently on proactive. ,1,1,0
Your acne looks similar to how mine did. I got rid of it by cutting out sugar, dairy, and refined carbs from my diet. Might be worth a try.,1,1,0
My god please don't listen to ANY of these people. I'm an 18 yr old male, I've had one breakout my entire life. A few small pimples on my jawline, and I flipped shit and began using all these shit chemicals on my face. To my avail, a week later it became worse. I then took a step back and looked what had changed from the week before. All the damn chemicals I was stuffing my face with just messed it up. Your skin can take care of itself, let it do so. No chemicals, no nothing. I'm currently using only water and lotion, and haven't had a breakout since ü§ô,-2,-2,0
Probably some blood stuck under a layer of skin from when you popped the pimple. I would place a warm wash cloth on it for a few minutes, dry it off, and put a hydrocolloid bandage on it. ,1,1,0
Check out make up artist choice, they have professional quality and strength chemical peels ,1,1,0
I would imagine you have tried so already, but the elimination of dairy and sugars tend to lead in improvement in most people (along with drinking lots of water). ,1,1,0

I'm a 21 y/o college student as well, and just came back from studying abroad, but coincidentally, my skin cleared for the first time in years when I came back from Europe. It wasn't the trip that cleared my acne, but the routine I started whilst there. I have VERY VERY sensitive skin, and oily skin as well, so my routine was tailored to that. If I am wearing makeup, I remove it with the Say Yes to Coconuts micellar water, then I use Panoxyl (10%) to cleanse my face. I pat dry and spray my face with rosewater and aloe, and while still wet I apply my moisturizer, which is the Aveeno ultra calming night cream or day moisturizer. Once my skin has absorbed that I use the derma-E scar gel, which is the only thing that actually helps new and old scars, and does not break me out further. Sometimes I substitute the Aveeno night cream for the derma-E vitamin C serum and night cream. Twice a week I exfoliate with the Nip Fab glycolic and salicylic acid exfoliator, and three times a week I make a turmeric and honey mask (WHICH DOES WONDERS) and let it sit for ten minutes to reduce inflammation. Something I also give credit to helping my skin is the IT cosmetics solid serum foundation. I have done a lot of research, and finally found a routine that is helping my skin breathe and repair, after years of misguided advice, numerous oral treatments (both prescription and non-prescription), and topical treatments.
If I were to list the four essential items that cleared my skin:
Panoxyl (10%),
Aveeno Ultra Calming Night Cream,
Turmeric,
& the Derma-E Scar Gel.,1,1,0

Wouldn't hurt! You don't necessarily need a "bad" case of acne to see one. A derm will be able to give you there opinion on how to go about treatment. ,5,5,0
You don't need to have severe acne before seeing a dermatologist. Even one pimple is enough to seek out advice on how to deal with it. Since it's mostly on your chin, it's likely hormonal, so the derm might suggest birth control as a way to deal with it, or alternatively topical creams.  
  
You can however also change your skincare routine and diet and get visible results without any prescription medications/creams. I can suggest some things if you're willing to share your current routine and diet.,3,3,0

That's pretty draconian. I wouldn't worry too much. Just cut out the easy stuff first (mostly processed refined stuff) see if that helps adequately. If it doesn't then reconsider the soy. I got rid of cystic acne by eating healthier but I still have plenty of soy...,1,1,0

It might be worth taking a break from it to see if it clears up any breakouts. You can make oat milk really easily at home.

Everybody is different. If you're worried about it you could eliminate it for a while and see if things get better. I'm vegan also; you could substitute soy milk and tofu with almond milk and tempeh. Or you could not worry about it, it personally doesn't affect my acne. ,1,1,0

Yes, Soy can be problematic. Here's a link to some studies covering the years 1950 to 2013. I'd say inflammation may only be part of the problem.

Sterility in the Rabbit Associated with Soybean Hay Feeding. J Nutr 1950 Dec;42(4):487-500. The study found that those rabbits that had consumed the soybean hay suffered from ‚Äúpartial reproductive failure.‚Äù The effects of this were seen in the smaller size of their litters, the number of stillbirths and early fetal deaths as well as ‚Äúnumerous partial fetal resorptions and some partial paralysis‚Äù of adult female offspring.

I took Doxy for about a year. I didn't notice results until three months in! I think you may be going through the purge stage right now. It should subside soon! In regards to going off it, I think it depends on the person. I remember absolutely dreading going off it because I was scared it was going to come back worse than before-- but to my surprise it didn't! I of course still break out, but not as much as I used to. Give it time :),1,1,0
When I took doxycycline about a year ago, it didn't seem to have results. I took it for 6 or 7 months (100 mg twice daily) and didn't see a difference at all. I stopped taking it since I don't like being on pills (I just prefer topical treatment and feel better about those than ingesting anything) and the only difference I saw was that my face was a but more oily, no increase or decrease in acne. I know that i'm just one case, but doxycycline just seemed like a waste of money for me after a long period of treatment.,1,1,0
Hey,

I took accutane for 9 months on 80mg a day. I was very sleepy during time I was taking it and basically all I did after school was go to bed. I am off of accutane for about 5 months now and I still don't have the same amount of energy I had before taking it. I'm also hoping it goes away.

Same here, thought my acne finally disappeared but that bitch came back stronger than ever. My mom thinks it's not even bad, but she doesn't understand how it effects us psychologically. It sucks being surrounded by friends with clear skin who complain about little to no acne. Each day I'm learning to accept I have acne little by little and honesty it's really hard. However I'm not going to let acne ruin my highschool years and make me miss out on so much in my life. So always know you're never alone when it comes to acne and that you will achieve that bomb ass skin. It takes time. 
,3,3,0
I was on accutane for about 4 months and and my skin cleared up and it was awesome. It was summer break and I didn't have a care in the world. Then, as I start approaching the next school year, all of my acne fucking came back! I never had the chance to be ance-free at school. I would strongly suggest talking your mom into buying Efaclear 5.5% benzoyl peroxide face wash. It works wonders. You just have to stick to it. For the first couple weeks wash only once a day and then apply it once a day so your skin gets a feel for it. Then switch to once in the morning and once at night. Keep doing it until your ance goes away. I started seeing results in less that a week. ,2,2,0
If your mom won't let you buy any treatment (wth!?) see if you find any Organic Apple Cider Vinegar already stashed around the house, and some Tea Tree Oil, too. Long story short, I've tried about everything to treat my acne and as of right now (been using both for almost 2 months) my skin is the clearest its been for years. And what's best is that it's inexpensive AND natural.

For the apple cider vinegar (not the Heinz one, make sure it's organic) mix half water, half vinegar and use it as a toner. For the tea tree, i mix about 1-3 drops with a dab of my moisturizer and put it on my face after the toner dries. (Sure, i'm also using some prescribed ointment but it's better than nothing if you can't obtain anything else!) I put these on at night, and use a gentle cleanser.

Good luck :/

It sucks, I know I too deal with acne. It's not as bad it it used to be ( I had severe acne), now I just have some pimples and mostly scars. It affected my self-esteem, but you gotta know that it will go away and that the people that truly care about you don't care if you have acne or not. Hang in there fellow warrior. And btw you should take your mom to a dermatologist with you so she sees what you have to do ( take Accutane for example )

100% go back to your derm if it's affecting your quality of life this much.

And stick to your meds. I got frustrated and went off mine for a month and now that I'm finally making progress I wish I had been on this track sooner. If you have a good derm, trust them. If you don't, find a new derm!

Hugs. It's hard going through this, and having comments or stares is awful. Someday when you have clear skin, no one but you will remember your bad skin!,1,1,0
I know I'm going to get flogged for posting this from my blog (my name dot com), but whatever:

Acne pep talk

One issue that tends to get glossed over is the emotional aspect. Many suffers are teenagers and emotions are already bubbling up and over like a super volcano waiting to go boom. Stress plus hormones and rapid life changes equals massive upheaval. I mention this to remind adults that acne vulgaris and acne rosacea can have severe and devastating impacts on a person's psyche and that it's not merely a rite of passage and easy burden to brush off. 

Especially not when our society is so image conscious and it seems like the totality of high school revolves around status and standing which can really crater when that heaping Godzilla of a zit pops up and roars to life, leaving havoc and emotional destruction in its wake. 

Anyone that's suffered from severe acne knows. I'm not talking about a few blackheads or whiteheads and woe is me. I'm talking about the whole damn facial battlefield that kills confidence and blows up the stress factor to like a million. It really is a compounding spiral.  

Throw in the flawless beauties and their ever so helpful advice about how you too would have a perfect complexion if you only washed your face a little more. That's if they're nice. The bastards, and everyone reading this page knows what I speak, can push the wrong buttons and leave your emotional elevator headed straight to hell.  

Newsflash: people are people and even though adulthood is supposed to cure us of the folly of adolescence, it doesn't necessarily. I'm saying this to anyone reading that may be young and think adults have it all figured out. We don't. Too often, life as an adult is merely a carry over of high school. You still have your flawless helpers and bastard supremes and status seekers and well, you get the idea. The only difference is your body isn't experiencing the accentuated ruin of hormonal napalm. Well, maybe not as much. 

Simply put, the meandering point I'm trying to make is that the world is tough. When the going gets tough, the tough take out their machete and wait, wait...wrong blog. No, what I was going for is that that we can't always control people's actions or how they perceive us but we can control how we respond. 

As simplistic as this sounds consider the next time a person casts a vile comment your way what must be going on underneath their mask and emotional hood. Good, decent people don't go out of their way to make others feel lower than animal excrement scraped from the bottom of one's shoe. They just don't-- unless they're having a particularly off day and you caught the blowback. Don't take it personal. Don't make it personal.       

Breath. Remember you are the culmination of complexities more astounding and numerable to count. Mark every blessing you have and be grateful. Rejoice in every amazing family member, friend that loves you and sees the astounding and beautiful treasure you truly are.  The world needs more beacons of light and less makers of shade.    ,1,1,0
The Bioderma micellar water does a great job at removing makeup and is gentle. You could try removing it with oil, but cleansing with oils is not for everyone so make sure to test it out first. I currently use baby wipes and they have not broken me out, they're kind of a quick way of getting rid of 80% of my makeup, which I finish off with a cleanser.
Oh, and as for the sweating- I've been sweating like crazy lately and what I do is just splash my face with water to get rid of the sweat and ,if I feel like it, run over with a toner.,2,2,0
You should remove your makeup before you cleanse. It's like sweeping before you mop. If you don't do it you're just moving makeup around on your face and not actually cleaning your skin. I would suggest using a proper cleansing oil for this. There are many brands that make gentle fragrance free cleansing oils. They make quick work out of what takes forever to do with a makeup wipe or a cleansing water. Most of them even take care of eye makeup, so you can have all your makeup off in about 30 seconds. Mixing oils from home will likely break you out. If you don't like an oil, a makeup removing balm will do the same thing.
As for cleaning sweat off the skin, throwing some makeup wipes in your bag is a great idea. These things suck at removing makeup, but they're great for a quick cleanse.,1,1,0
I've been on clindamycin gel a little over 6 weeks now, and it was really effective in terms of reducing my breakouts. I've gone from having 4-6 new pimples every week (and way more a couple days before my period) to maybe 1 small pimple a week. For me, the gel doesn't appear to do that much for removing and healing the breakouts, but my skin did look much clearer about 1-1.5 weeks after twice daily use, after my existing breakouts healed and it reduced the future breakouts. ,2,2,0
ive been on doxycycline and monocycline and let me tell you, i wish my stupid fucking doctor never gave me that stuff. it helps while youre on it but when you stop taking it, it comes back. my dumb doctor never told me that antibiotics kill good gut bacteria (i was young so i didnt wanna question a "superior" human) trust me the only thing that can put in acne in remmission for a long time or even forever is accutane. accutane is the best thing invented ,3,3,0
Be VERY careful with Tretinoin. I went from clear skin to a straight up pizza face in a matter of a week. I was on tretinoin 0.0009% clindamycin 1% azelaic acid 9%. As for doxycycline, I'd be careful with that too. Some people despise it. I was prescribed it also and decided against it. ,1,1,0

If it's a cyst he should be able to drain it for you, it might be a good idea to go back to your GP and they can recommend someone who does small procedures on site.

I managed to get rid of a cyst by dousing some cotton wool in tea tree oil and sticking it over the cyst with medical tape for a few nights. It dried up and left a very gross scab but it peeled off and the skin underneath was fine.

Don't quote me on the science of the tea tree oil method though.,3,3,0

I have the exact same skin type and Accutane was my only hope. Now, I'm able to use Paula's Choice Clear in the morning and Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash with a scrubbing pad at night, and it works. Absolutely nothing worked for me before Accutane. As you know, most topical washes or creams don't go deep enough to reach cystic acne and sensitive skin makes it impossible to use anything harsh.,2,2,0
Ren Clearcalm 3 clarifying clay cleanser has been amazzzing for me since I discovered it. My skin is almost always dry and is now acne prone but this is the only cleanser that doesn't sting/burn EVER no matter the kind of day I'm having with my skin. It's available at Sephora.

I use that cleanser after using a cotton pad and cetaphil gentle makeup remover (from Walmart or whatever drugstore you use). I like this better than any fancy micellar water I've found at Sephora.,1,1,0
I just ordered 2 products from Phisoderm. Anti-Blemish Gel Cleanser and fragrance free cream cleanser sensitive skin. On their Web site they have new products (more expensive) that work on getting your skin to its correct PH level but expect the same theme in their other products. I'll see what happens. Otherwise, I'll look at a Cetaphil cleanser. I have oily skin and only benzoyl peroxide works but I don't want to use it anymore. The oils in natural soaps made my skin red/irritated  so they weren't successful if you were looking at organic. I went to Suave Professionals 2 in 1 ph balanced shampoo and hair is more healthy. I was using shampoo that was too alkaline (higher ph).,1,1,0
It's only been three days using the Phisoderm Anti-Blemish gel cleanser and it's the best thing I have tried out that my skin could handle. You can ship to your Walgreens store to save on shipping costs. Phisoderm has a few cleansers to pick from. Cetaphil gentle cleanser was junk didn't work for me. I used once and returned to the store.,1,1,0
I was on doxycycline for about 2 months. I never really noticed any heartburn or whatnot. The only side effect I noticed was stomach discomfort is I took it on an empty stomach. I always had to eat before or within 15-20 minutes of taking it.,3,3,0
THIS IS IMPORTANT: take the doxycycline with plenty of water and make sure to stay upright for a couple hours after taking it!!! it will help the acne, but I made the mistake of swallowing them with barely any water if at all and laying down and i had the worst pain in my esophagus for a couple of weeks. ,3,3,0

Like you mentioned introduce products one at a time... it's strange that the salicylic cleanser is breaking you out. How long have you been using it? I have read somewhere that salicylic in a cleanser doesn't actually stay on the face long enough to have too much of an effect in comparison with it in toners, for example.

But as you said you have sensitive skin I really wouldn't use salicylic or do ANY type of exfoliation (so that rules out charcoal scrub and St Ives). And I know you said you didn't like to use products from different lines but, honestly, you may need to if one products isn't working for you, you believe. For example, I've found I like Agera Rx's Gentle Cleanser, their Antibacterial Peptide Cream, but hate their Oil Free Moisturiser (as I swear it was the cause of my sudden breakouts when using it). Also, I recommend using the website COSDNA to cross check ingredients in the products you want to use to see if any are 'pore-clogging' and become savvy with which ingredients are potentially breaking you out. Also washing your face more than twice a day is not recommended as it can aggravate acne.

I, personally, have not used any of the cleansers you have listed but Cetaphil is a popular, gentle one with the acne community. If I were to give you advice on which one would be best for you I wouldn't be able to first-hand. If it is a gentle cleanser you are 100% after definitely avoid salicylic and Glycolic acids (so avoid Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser).

As someone with acne-prone, combination sensitive skin I find the biggest problem is moisturisers so that may actually be the cause of your breakouts and not the cleanser? Also do you use benzoyl peroxide to treat your acne? If you think your skin is getting bad I would spot treat with that. It is the best of the acne-targeting products out there.

My advice: do your research into ingredients beneficial for acne and ingredients that aggravate it and perhaps read into reviews from people suffering like you on the products you are interested in. ,1,1,0
My first note, and this is pretty important I think, is DO NOT USE PHYSICAL SCRUBS. They might feel good but they actually aren't doing a deep exfoliation and can cause micro tears in the skin which in turn leads to more acne. 

I would recommend using an AHA or a BHA, which are both chemical exfoliants. BHAs usually go deeper than AHAs, which are known to be fairly gentle. Salicylic acid is a common BHA, but it's up to you if you wanna try it again after the Neutrogina fail. AHAs wise, the most common ones are lactic acid and glycolic acid. Lactic is the lightest exfoliation of them all. I personally am going to start using The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% and Hyaluronic acid 2% pretty soon. I'd recommend this one if you're just getting into chemical exfoliants, but The Ordinary also sells 10% lactic acid formulations as well as glycolic ones. Start off exfoliating every other day, and then if you want, go up to every day. I wouldn't recommend twice a day though as it's easy to go overboard. Also, these make you more sensitive to the sun, so wear sunscreen. 

If you are planning on wearing makeup, which is totally fine, you gotta make sure you get it all off in the evening. Double cleansing is good for this. You start off with an oil or something similar (even if you have oily skin) and then do a regular cleanse. It might be scary to think about putting oil on oily/clog prone skin, but it's all about finding the right one. Some people really like rosehip oil and jojoba oil for acne, but I can't say much on these as they made me break out. Another popular product is Clinique take the day off cleansing balm. If oils are too scary still, try a micellar water. I'm about to start using the Simple Micellar Water since it had good reviews, but garnier micellar water (with the pink cap) is popular too. 

I use the neutrogina naturals cleanser and it's ok for me, so I don't have much to say on cleansers. It's the only one I've ever used. 

I also was thinking about using the Mario badescu drying lotion, but remember that it's mostly for whiteheads, and if you have cysts the internet recommends using their buffering lotion. 

I think I'm pretty much out of things to say, so I hope this helps! Sorry about the whole "not all one brand thing" from my recommendations. Feel free to ask any more questions as I've spent a lot of time researching this type of stuff and could maybe help you out some more if you need. Good luck with everything!

If you have mild acne, you may want to use Benzoyl Peroxide and see how that goes.,1,1,0
Is there a reason you haven't been to the dermatologist?,3,3,0
I'm 17 and that happened to me too , I always ignored it since I've never been too self conscious but it gets to you , ik how you feel. I used everything from benzoyl to clindamycin and it never helped I was always prescribed pills but I never took them cuz I don't like pills in general. I eventually just convinced my mother to put my on accutane since it works most of the time, go to a derm and tell them to give you benzoyl and try it out for a few months atleast and try other things sometimes creams and things do work but other times like for me they don't. ( if you do decide to give accutane a try just tell the derm to explain it to you such as side effects since it gives you some serious ones which are usually very rare tho , do your research , I did it and I'm on month 4 80mg a day and I haven't had things out of the ordinary only just the usual such as dry lips and skin , joint pain and back pain but not extreme mostly just annoying but I can ignore it ) ALSO TRY ALOE VERA like the fresh one and put it on your face it helped me so much with scars and acne altho it works super slow.,1,1,0
Before this photo, I was actually very clear skinned but the last 10 days it's progressively gotten worse. Started with one pimple but now it's starting to spread in a small cluster. Not sure what's going on... whether it's hormone related with the BC or stress, it's starting to bum me out a little. I went through a MASSIVE breakout, all over my face back in 2015 (took close to 2 years to clear it) and I'm nervous. My skin was completely clear for the past 2 months, except for one or two when I'm on the placebo pills but I'm not sure what's going on :( ,1,1,0

im sorry to hear that man. luckily accutane got rid of my acne. maybe try elimating certain foods from your diet ... thats worked for alottt of people. dairy is number 1 culprit ,1,1,0
The only thing that's ever helped me w cysts is a bit of prep H. Nothing miraculous though,1,1,0
It's strange that a derm wouldn't offer cortisone shots. Anywho, Neosporin will only help after the pimple has been popped to promote healing. Have you tried lancing it and putting a hydrocolloid bandage over it?,1,1,0
10% benzoyl peroxide if you want to dry it out.,3,3,0
Benzoyl peroxide ,2,2,0
I use a mix of azelaic acid, tretinoin 0.5% and Mario Badescu's drying lotion. Apparently the first two work together to dry out pimples. The drying lotion works best for pimples with pus. ,1,1,0
 I mostly use benzoyl peroxide but sometimes I use green clay masks and dab it on the bad areas. ,1,1,0
Use benzoyl peroxide but start with the lower 2.5% than work your way up to 5% and if needs be 10%. 10%, personally though, is just too over the top.,1,1,0

Eliminating dairy eliminated probably 95% of my acne. I still get the occasional spot but no cystic ones. I eat wheat maybe once a week and a small amount of added sugar so it could be that. 

This was after 9 months on Accutane, getting great results, but the acne returning after finishing the Accutane. So I took a more "inside-out" approach and tried to determine the source of the problem.,8,8,0
Eh, your mileage may vary. In the past I have tried (for several months each change...) vegan, gluten free, wheat free, sugar free, high fat, low carb and NOTHING. It's very frustrating :(,3,3,0
For what it's worth, I just had the same experience. I'm on the vegan diet and was eating lots of oatmeal and brown rice. I cut those out and inflammation went way down. I also juice twice a day, 2 cucumbers, carrots, and an apple. I believe that helps a lot as well by cooling the body down. In TCM, internal heat causes inflammation that leads to skin problems. I think the cucumbers really help. ,3,3,0

Manuka honey! Used as a mask after washing,1,1,0
People are going to give you all these ideas and products but none of it will matter if you don't clean your face every morning and night. You have to open the pores with hot water, then you apply whatever treatment then cool your face down to close the pores throughout the day/night. Believe me, you do not want to apply the acne medication on dirty skin. I had been using the same medication that I've been using successfully now and I would break out regardless if there was still oil/sweat. Good luck!,1,1,0
Different products affect people differently. Some makeup does break people out but can work great for others. What is important is making sure you wash it off completely every night.,4,4,0
I have sensitive skin that breaks out from most foundations. Bb creams are the only thing that doesn't break me out. Start with a light bb cream that doesn't have a lot of spf so it isn't too heavy or oily feelings. I would use the maybelline Dream pure bb cream. It doesn't give a lot of coverage but has enough pigment to just make everything blend together better. 

After that you could switch to a heavier coverage bb cream. The garnier bb cream is my holy grail. Heavy medium coverage and leaves your skin looking fresh and dewey but still isn't oily feeling ,1,1,0
It's ok to be upset about your skin. I'm sorry you're feeling this way, it really sucks and I've definitely been there. First thing- lose the pink grapefruit wash. Pretty sure it has fragrance and harsh alcohols. Instead try cetaphil or cerave gentle washes.  If you were just prescribed the tretinoin in June (is this the case? I may be misinterpreting) then it's very likely you're purging from it. This probably means that it's working and you should stick with it for a while longer.

What else have you tried?,4,4,0
Awww, I'm so sorry to hear about that. I understand the feeling when things seem to finally get better only for it go downhill again! But don't give up hope! 
Like the other user have said, sometimes Tretinoin does cause purging. It could be because the zits/pimples, that were underneath your skin, not yet ready to come to a head/laying dormant, is finally coming up because of the tretinoin. If this is a big concern, you should definitely contact your derm! 

Best of luck :),2,2,0
Ok just re-read your post. Typically for retinol a your purging stage starts about a month in. It really really sounds like that's what this is. On retinols you can purge for up to 6 weeks.,1,1,0
Get a color corrector to wear under your makeup.,2,2,0
Is this the only product you've added recently? You shouldn't be purging from a cleanser so I would discontinue and see what happens. I will admit I am slightly biased since this cleanser gave me a horrible whole face breakout within a couple of weeks of use. When I stopped using it my face immediately calmed down. ,1,1,0
I suggest visiting the derm. Yeah it's pricey but it's worth it. I used to avoid the derm cos of the cost but I realised none of the OTC products worked for me. The derm would know your skin type and acne type best. ,2,2,0
Eat less simple carbohydrates, and more vegetables/ fish. Just try it for a week and you will notice changes ,1,1,0
Manuka honey. Easily the quickest (first use) and most effective remedy I have found. ,1,1,0
weird, i simply asked my GP to send me to dermatologis and he didnt even hesitate, im surprised yours wont let you. But you do know you dont have to be referred by a GP.. i know people who just went straight to the derm and got it right away. i hope you get put on it soon though, accutane is the best thing ever made and it saved my life ,1,1,0
Maybe it's a sexist thing? It's common knowledge that you should not get pregnant while on it, and they even make you do monthly blood tests while also checking for pregnancy, plus you have to be on birth control, plus you need to verify every month with the company that you're not pregnant and using a primary (the pill) AND secondary (i.e, condom) method of bc, etc. I had the feeling my doctors didn't have much trust in me to be responsible. 

Maybe I'm stereotyping smaller towns, but they might be a bit iffy on the topic of a risky pregnancy / potential of abortion / a young woman not being sexually responsible.

Idk but good luck, I'm sending positive thoughts your way! The stuff will change your life. ,1,1,0
Aldactone/Spironolactone. It's a diuretic and has left me with virtually no symptoms and clear skin. I tried Accutane and it never worked, along with antibiotics, creams, and cleaners.

Look into this. I feel like a new person.,1,1,0
I'm using Cerave Hydrating Cleanser/ Facial Moisturizing Lotion twice a day atm.

Epiduo and Doxycycline at night. Most of the bumps just don't seem to go away at all. The ones on my forehead are somewhat recent, but the stuff on the side has been there for months.

I've been told I should just wait it out, but I want to get a second opinion on if it might be something else, or if there's some other product that I should be trying...

Thanks

I know a girl in my town that had this happen. He hair also became much darker, weird right? 

However it's certainly not a bad thing!!,1,1,0
Same!!!.. initially, i thought that it was because once my haircut went a little wrong and that might have changed the growth pattern, highly unlikely, i know, but i couldn't find any other reason. I hate it tho, it forms a wave right in the middle of the head when it gets long, lol.,1,1,0
Did you try adding BHA or AHA to your routine? They can improve the texture quite a bit. (And help with hyperpigmentation),2,2,0
If texture is your issue look into doing some laser treatments. From what I hear they can dramatically improve texture concerns. Check with a derm!

And I'm sorry you're feeling like hiding. I've been there and nothing I can say will make you feel better, I know. But know that you're not alone and no one gives anywhere close to as many shits about your skin as you do. Hoping you will find relief!,1,1,0
Do you mind me asking if you are on any type of birth control? I had tons of problems with my BC & skin. ,1,1,0
you shouldnt do antibiotics for acne... it kills the good bacteria in your gut and when you get off it your acne will come back,-1,-1,0
Just don't touch them and don't use physical scrubs on them. Cleanser with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide can help. It should disappear after 4-6 days.,3,3,0
Wash your face with cold water. At the end of your showers, turn the water to the coldest for just a few seconds. Apparently cold water closes the pores to prevent more acne. 

Don't touch your face, your hands may be a little dirty so try avoid touching your face even if it's itching. 

I believe tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil help acne disolve. 


Im definitely not an expert but I think those tips can prevent it from getting worse at least.,4,4,0
Definitely try benzoyl peroxide. It works wonders if you stick to it. ,1,1,0
Accutane puts a strain on your liver and so does alcohol which is why it's not recommended.  Whilst you may not cause permanent damage only doing it once you likely will have a worse than usual hang over and regular drinking will leave you at a heightened risk of lasting liver problems.  All in all I'd say it's not worth and just don't bother for the few months of your course... you don't have to be drunk to still have fun. ,3,3,0
your acne might be related to your stress, however it can be many other things as well- diet, hormones, etc. ,2,2,0
Acne can be caused by loads of things, often in combination, including plain old genetics.

If you have OCD to the point that it's affecting your ability to live normally then you should definitely seek help. Stress hormones can be associated so you could see some acne clearing, but more importantly you could see improvement in your ability to control the compulsions and live more normally.,1,1,0
OCD is a subset of anxiety. It‚Äôs characterized by developing strict, repetitive rituals and routines in order to deal with fears and anxieties, and those with OCD fear severe consequences if the rituals are broken. What‚Äôs worse is that they often realize the rituals are irrational ‚Äì which can cause a lot of distress ‚Äì but they just. can‚Äôt. stop. Classic rituals for OCD sufferers usually include things like obsessive hand washing, counting objects, and checking 20 times that the stove is really off. For those with acne, it can manifest in excessive skin picking and preening, obsessive face washing and topical application, and completely unreasonable fears and routines revolving around food.,1,1,0
I'm on it. It depends on your dose, what your T levels were, and of course the fact that everyone is different.

What dose did they start you on?,1,1,0
I've been on it for ~8 months and love it. No symptoms, wouldn't change a thing. ,1,1,0
I just started! I'm on 50mg a day and I've been taking it for 2 weeks. So far I'm sad because I am breaking out even more. I asked my dermatologist if this was normal and she was like "it's fine". No idea. I really hope this works in the long run. I've tried everything else in the world except accutane. 

I have a new breakout every day and it's really discouraging. I hope it clears up soon. I'm really crossing my fingers for Spiro. 
,1,1,0
IMO it's not the sweating that helped.

Moving helps. Getting really hungry before eating helps. And then moving some more after eating helps to keep your blood sugar level down.

Basically move more to get hungrier. Or eat less often to get hungrier. Or better both.

In all these years, this is the only way that reliably helped me to get rid of acne.,2,2,0
Whey protein. I used to hide the fact that I took whey protein so I couldnt get solid advice, but once I stopped taking it my life basically changed. If I had told people I took whey, they wouldve told me to stop immediately. Its a root cause of bad acne for a lot of people. Maybe you dont take whey, but this is just a piece of advice for fellow redditors who are scrolling around this subreddit! I used to want to look jacked and all, but with a pimply face that comes with it, working out was stressing me out mentally.

Maybe you usually drink milk or eat cheese, but didnt in Portugal. Or maybe you werent getting enough sleep, but did in portugal. Dont forget your sunscreen too! Portugal is  a beautiful country (:,1,1,0
I used to be oily befor I understood that I should moisturize and not use a drying cleanser. Maybe your skin is overproducing?,2,2,0

Sorry dude, heres some advice...the accutane should help all acne, give it time and drink water and then drink more water. I know it sucks. Cut out dairy for a month, see if it helps. Change and wash your sheets and pillow case every day. When you have the money and skin is cleared, do lazer treatment for the scarring. Hopefully you realize there is help and it will get better, a long ass time, but it will. Then grow a sweet beard and stache and fight off the ladies in your 20's. Good luck,10,10,0
Stick with the accutane. It will work. It takes time but you will be amazed once it kicks in. Mine took me 5 months to get completely clear then I did 2 more months. I would do accutane again without hesitation. You will get through this.,5,5,0

Did you managed to extract the puss out of it? If you did, then the bump is normal since it's in the process of healing. It'll stay around for a week or two and eventually flatten out if you keep your hands off it. :),1,1,0

You should really get it checked out, it could be MRSA which is very dangerous.,1,1,0
no but make sure you dilute it ,3,3,0
Seconding -Clouddyy... Apple cider vinegar is, well, a vinegar. All vinegars are anywhere from 5-10% acetic acid, so pretty acidic. Plenty of people have tried topical ACV for acne without realizing to dilute it first (I've seen recommended ratios from 1:3 ~at least~ up to 1:10 parts vinegar:water). Many of these people who did not dilute suffered at least uncomfortable stinging of skin but some have suffered actual acidic burns. Not fun. When in doubt, it when first trying ACV, dilute more than you think you need to. When that ratio turns out okay then you can slightly increase the acidity for next time, allowing your skin to slowly become acclimated.,3,3,0
ACV is excellent but has anyone come up with a great way for the smell? Obviously you can dilute it and/or wash it off after a limited time, but what if you leave it on for prolonged periods? ,1,1,0
if you drink a shot of it it clears your skin from the inside out,1,1,0

i just finished month two and i say stick on it. it's possible acne could come back and you're going to wish you stayed on it if it ever does come back. but you're side effects are worse than mine by far. i only have minor dry lips and a little back pain, so my case is a little different,2,2,0
Just because you cleared up quickly does not mean you are done with your course. There is a certain dosage of the drug that needs to be reached over time in order for it to be considered a full treatment, which is why most people are on it for 5-6 months- to teach the cumulative dosage. 

I stopped accutane after two months my first time doing it since I was clear and figured I didn't need it anymore. Worst mistake ever. My acne came back worse than ever before. I am currently entering my fifth month of my second course. Just stick with it. 

Those side effects are all normal and some can be dealt with. Fish oil for back and joint pain. Artificial tears for the dry eyes (helped me so much). Aquaphor. Moisturizer. ,1,1,0
Accutane is a derivative of Vitmain A so I'm surprised to hear about the eye issue. It's one hell of a drug, but damn it it works. I had the dry nose and joint pain all 9 months but it was worth it. 

You can also help your body maintain after the course is done by improving your diet (cut out as much added sugar as you can, no junk food, no soda, no bread, no dairy even). Inflammation is something to avoid. ,1,1,0
I am 3 weeks off accutane and i still feel a bit more tired than usual, and my eyes still look a little sleepy, but it's going away slowly..so i guess you should stick to it. If the eyes get too dry you can get some eye drops,1,1,0
I wouldn't stop. Do we know this vision problem is accutane related?Are your eyes dry? That's what it sounds like to me. Maybe sleep with eye ointment and use drops during the day.,1,1,0
Thank you guys for the support and input. I just got back from an optometrist and was told that I have dry eyes. My vision is 20/20 and everything else is perfect. I was told to do eye scrubs twice a day and apply eye drops (systane) twice a day. My only worry is will this persist after accutane and be permanent? I can handle all the other side effects, but I don't want to have dry, red eyes for the rest of my life.,1,1,0
Have you looked into gluten being the possible cause for your acne? I have eczema and moderate acne. A couple months ago a coworker of mine said that she had similar problems with acne and feeling bloated, etc. Couple weeks later a customer mentioned how much better she felt after going gluten free, so I decided to give it a try.

 
About 3 weeks to a month into it I could definitely see a positive difference in my skin. I still had acne but it was on the milder side. I did some more research on gluten and read that there are certain products that have ingredients that contain gluten molecules in them, and that for certain individuals even cross contamination could be an issue for them. And apparently, even some cosmetic products have ingredients that contain gluten! 

For certain reasons pertaining to the military I had to get a gluten allergy test done to confirm that I had a reaction to it so it could be documented. The website I ordered the lab test for mentioned that if I suspected I had a gluten sensitivity and had been on a gluten free diet, that it may alter the accuracy of the test since there would be no gluten in my system to check.

I loaded up on gluten this past Sunday to ensure I had more than enough, and the following morning was HORRIBLE. I had the worst headache I'd had in years, when I stood up to go eat I felt nauseous, I had diarrhea...I actually called my best friend and told him I thought I had salmonella poisoning. I could barely move! I decided to try and wait it out first and went back to sleep. I woke up feeling better but I noticed my acne went absolutely haywire.


I know I probably gave you more than you asked for but it's worth a shot. I also suspect I might have a mild reaction to soy so you could try cutting that out too. Wishing you the best of luck!,5,5,0
Do you have hormonal issues? Maybe PCOS? If nothing is helping, seems like that could be the cause. It is for me! :(,2,2,0

Hmmmm I would try a benzoyl peroxide treatment (like effaclar duo, my absolute fave!) because it's probably a bacterial growth issue and the BP will kill all of that for you so that it doesn't spread.

Honestly dude I wouldn't even stress about your acne. You probably judge it very harshly but honestly your skin is good! If I met you and you had skin like that I honestly wouldn't even take notice of it. ,2,2,0
Limit your sugar.,1,1,0
"Natural" does not necessarily mean better for you. A lot of things you have in your recipe are actually bad for your skin. I'm hoping by coffee you don't mean coffee grinds (because that is sandpaper for your face), but even if that's true salt and sugar don't moisturize. They are really too abrasive if you are having problems with acne. To help your skin, you have to be your skin. Plus, salt itself dehydrates. I'm not sure which oil you use, but a lot of cooking oils are bad for skin. There's a lot more info in the sidebar. I recommend the boring-looking Cetaphil or CeraVe moisturizers because they are very gentle but work well to moisturize your skin. ,3,3,0
Jojoba, Argan, and Rose Hip are best for oily, acne-prone skin and they have amazing effects.
You can read up on the different oils that tend to break people out from a scale of 1-5. These three are like 0-1 on that scale. ,2,2,0
Rosehip oil is an amazing moisturizer. Check out what's in it, and you'll love it.,1,1,0
My faves are Jojoba and Pomegranate. I use those without any issue. Honey is amazing for acne-prone skin as it helps with healing and kills bacteria.

If you are looking for oils that won't clog pores, search Google for oils with a 0, 1, or 2 comedogenic level. [This](http://www.holistichealthherbalist.com/complete-list-of-comedogenic-oils/) is a good source, for instance.,1,1,0

This is so true. Though it's so hard to tell ourselves this during the time we have to deal with it. Emotionally, we feel like the whole world has a magnifying glass and is studying us with a close inspection.

you cant get rid of acne in 2 weeks. lol get real. if its that much of a problem for you then go to a dermatologist ,3,3,0
Biggest thing you can do is change your pillow case every 2 nights (one side a night), make sure you're moisturizing to keep your skin from getting too oily, exfoliate once a day maximum, preferably every second day or something like that and use a gentle face wash every other time. 
If you're after a topical, benzoyl peroxide can usually be bought over the counter and use that at night time. 

Eating a good amount of vegetables can help out quite a bit as well, healthy body = healthy organs,1,1,0
I think this may be purging. I'd say keep going but keep up with your doctor. My derm always told me it would get worse before it gets better
,2,2,0
It might be. Are you breaking out in new places where you didn't have pimples before?,1,1,0
I started about a month ago as well and have bumps all over my face. I was going through the worst break out I've had in years so I can't really tell if it made my acne worse, it's kind of the same. But I definitely have more skin colored bumps than I did before. I would say that this seems to be normal. 

Just stick in there and maybe worst case ask for antibiotics. When I started epiduo, I had also started antibiotics for an unrelated condition. I was completely clear within 25 days and had no purging. The only reason I didn't ask my doctor is due to the fact that I've been on so many antibiotics that I just don't think it would be healthy for me. ,1,1,0
take accutane and stop eating dairy/junk food. if ur acne is genetic then idk what to do but if its not then take accutane and watch videos to learn about what foods can be triggers for your acne. i was in the same boat as you but i learned feeling sorry for yourself doesnt do anything ,2,2,0
My brother started to get pimples at that age as well and my mum bought him a Clearasil face wash; however it turned his skin bright red so I wouldn't jump in with those type of products for her just yet. 
The Cetaphil Antibac bar would be perfect for her skin right now, I believe.

Also I would maybe teach her to spot-treat with something natural and antibacterial like tea tree at the moment too; I think BP would be a step too far right now because her skin will be very sensitive still. ,6,6,0
If she's using soap to wash her face, try switching to a cleanser. ,2,2,0

Do a little research on Demodex mite and acne/ Rosacea. It's a small mite that lives in human eyebrows/ eyelash follicles and virtually everyone has them by senescence. This may, or may not, be a factor. ,1,1,0
I use 2 tbs apple cider vinegar with the mother, 6 tbs aloe Vera juice, 2 drops roman chamomile essential oil. Store in fridge and shake before use. Do not add water. Apply with cotton swabs and keep in a glass container. This completely cured my acne. I do not use anything else on my face. ,1,1,0
At that degree I'd definitely say it's hormonal, try not only seeing your dermatologist but also an endocrinologist. My acne was similar to this before taking accutane. It was a little rough, but definitely worth it if it significantly affecting your self esteem. ,1,1,0
I am not an expert/doctor so don't take me word for word and I don't claim to know if this will help you, but if accutane didn't help you it sounds like you have a hormonal problem...

Accutane didn't help me and I tried about 5 different birth control pills out there - even the ones that were 'designed' to clear up acne (Yaz/Dianette, etc). None of them cleared my skin and most gave me mood swings and made me vomit every time I took them. It wasn't until I told my doctor they clearly weren't working that he said I should stop with the conventional 'acne-clearing' pills and gave me a low dose estrogen birth control pill (mine is called Gedarel 20 and I'm in the UK). That pill two days after I took it kicked in and by week one I had no new pimples forming. It has cleared my acne and 8 months later I get the odd tiny pustule/papule here and there...

If you're willing to go back on birth control they help hormonal acne. I don't understand the science behind it and I don't know if mine was just a coincidence. It may be or may not be. But if I was you perhaps look into birth control pills that a big consensus of people say didn't give them side effects and helped their skin and beg your mum to listen to you.

Also: as your acne definitely sounds hormonal also try cutting out dairy as it's laced with cow hormones (try it for about two weeks). ,2,2,0

Something thats really helped me out is drinking a big glass of water with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and half a lemon. oh yea only drink water. 

Wash your face only twice a day with a gentle skin cleanser 

Supplements ive heard work wonders is Zinc and l lysine,2,2,0
I've found that tea tree oil brings acne to a head really fast, and gets rid of it after it brings it to a head. But it really burns my skin and makes it peel on the spots I put it on.,1,1,0
I use aloe vera and it helps smooth out the splotchy appearance... not a cure but it helps a little,1,1,0
Adapalene gel has always worked well for me..and i never got any initial breakout from it, right now i finished my course of accutane and am using differin as maintenance..and its helping with my PIH as well. So yeah, you should definitely try it.,3,3,0
Worked for me too. It got worse the first two weeks then has been slowly improving. I started with differin for a month then added bp 30 minutes after I apply differin. Would 100 percent recommend differin. Just read up on everything and what to expect, it's your face and a powerful drug so make sure you don't go into it naively,1,1,0
I find putting ice (wrapped in a cloth) helps. But if you want more instant relief hydrocortisone, but I advise you use it sparingly...,1,1,0
Whenever I break the skin laws and pick, it's a very full white head and I pick AFTER I do step one face wash. After I pick, I put rubbing alcohol wherever I picked, then my step two toner, and 10% benzoyl peroxide spot treatment. This definitely helps keeping it from clogging up the pores again. If it's super bloody, I use a dab of Neosporin and it's mostly healed by morning. That personally works wonders for me, good luck!,6,6,0
So if I have a massive whitehead that I don't feel like walking around with for the world to see I go ahead and pop it. Yes picking is bad BUT it makes zits disappear a lot faster. I generally do it at night after my face is clean. Then before I put in my moisturizer I put a hydro colloid acne patch over it. 

Here's the link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BRGUNV2/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_Vs.EzbT5A23G9

Ever pop a zit and then wake up to find it has filled up and gotten even more gross over night? Well these patches absorb the crap oozing out of the popped zit. And when you wake up the zit substantially less swollen and has not "refilled" itself again. Seriously it's the best 8$ you'll ever spend. ,6,6,0
"Peace out acne" hydrocolloid patches are like $20/box at Sephora and once you figure out how to use them, they are awesome.,3,3,0
Cortisone cream and neosporin aren't bad ideas either,1,1,0
It sounds like yours is hormonal. Talk to your doctor about it.

I have hormonal acne and since I started taking BC and skipping blank pills (as well as taking spironolactone and adding azelaic acid and an increased dose of retinol) as part of my regimen and it's helped.,1,1,0
I've had a great experience with accutane. Achy joints is my only complaint. Monthly Dr visits aren't my idea of a good time but it's very much worth it!,4,4,0
I love this so much. It's the only thing that cured my acne. I had awful cystic acne. I took this for a few months, it disappeared and 4 years later I've never had a breakout like I used to. I only have small ones now and just one or two when I'm about to get my period.

The only side effect I had was dry lips. Annoying at first but found a lip balm that worked for me. You can always discontinue if you start to feel any untoward effects. You're also monitored so you shouldn't worry so much about it.

One of the best things I've ever taken.,3,3,0
I was on Accutane for 6 months after 3 years of trying everything under the sun that my Dermatologist threw at me. I'm so glad I did, though it was a total pain in the ass, it was worth it. 
The worst side effects I had were in the first 2 months.

* dry, peeling lips

* sensitive skin around eyes peeled just like a sunburn does, only it lasted for around 2 weeks and was intense!

* my face was generally red and dry but eventually improved with proper moisturizing

I can't say whether my body eventually got used to it or if it was the cetaphil, but once I started using cetaphil gentle cleanser and moisturizing cream twice a day the dry skin vastly improved within a week and eventually disappeared, revealing the most perfect skin I've ever had even to this day. I will also say another side effect I don't see mentioned a lot is that before accutane I had extremely oily hair, would have to wash every single day to avoid looking dirty, but once I started accutane I could finally go a day or two *easily* between washes and found that my scalp would get dry and burn easily, so hats in the sun were a must!

My acne stayed away for at least a year after stopping accutane, and took another good couple years to come back hormonally after I stopped taking the required birth control. Never as severe as it was in my early teens though, thank goodness! It is now manageable with AHA/BHA and glycolic acid products!,2,2,0
Did accutane at age 30 after having acne from age 15.  Over those 15 years I became immune to multiple antibiotics, spend lots of money on prescriptions, and still had acne.

My only Accutane regret is not doing it sooner.,2,2,0
Really, really not that bad. I've been on it for 3 months now. 3 more to go. My joints are a little achy when I wake up in the morning but other than that it's just the normal dry lips and dry skin (which is what it's supposed to do).    
My blood tests have been great but everyone is different. If you've tried topicals and antibiotics like I did, this is the next step to take and honestly you'll be glad you did. ,4,4,0
You should visit /r/accutane ,1,1,0
Accutane is a miracle drug. I had the world's worst bacne and it cleared it up pronto. Then there is a six month halo effect where your skin stays clear without taking the drug.,1,1,0
I just got off of accutane about a month and a half ago. I experienced dry skin, dry lips, joint pain, and the occasional eye dryness. It's honestly not that bad symptom wise and while it's pretty miserable, it's definitely worth it,1,1,0
You might want to check out the wiki page for it, too. Good info.

"Isotretinoin was first marketed as Accutane by Hoffmann-La Roche. It sold well for many years, but in 2009, Roche decided to remove Accutane from the US market after juries had awarded millions of dollars in damages to former Accutane users over inflammatory bowel disease claims. It then became generic and as of 2017 was marketed under many brand names worldwide.[1]"

A Vegan YouTuber named Brian Turner used to have horrible acne, he then used Accutane along with more natural things. He made a video on why you shouldn't use Accutane, I recommend you go watch it. Just search up "Brian Turner Why You Shouldn't Use Accutane",0,0,0
I used bare minerals when I was younger, actually it was the first makeup I had ever used.  When I started to get older, I began testing other brands and I remember one shopping trip in ulta, one of the employees there told me that the bare minerals may have actually been adding to my acne! She told me that bare minerals broke her out severely. Of course everyone's skin is different, but that conversation only made me want to try out other brands even more!  I found that other brands have much better coverage too. If you're looking for full coverage, bare minerals is not for you in my opinion.

If you want a natural looking coverage, I'd say go for it! I recently bought their blemish remedy powder foundation and tea tree oil primer and their both so-so. I would only reach for it if I wanted light coverage to cover some redness on the go. A product that I do swear by though is their well rested under-eye concealer powder/brightener! I've repurchased it so many times and it is AMAZING.,5,5,0
I had horrible acne for years, and honestly I feel bare minerals helped. I use original, their blush is great too. It is natural, non-comedogenic, and if you buy the starter kit the brushes are high quality. I have been using nothing but bareminerals for 12+ years (I'm 30) and people think I'm younger. It seems expensive when you're buying it, but a little pod of it will last 3+ months for foundation, compared to a few weeks for drugstore crap so in the long run it is more economical. Blush lasts me about 6-9 months, so totally worth it. Their eyeshadow and primers I'm not sold on, but their foundation, blush and concealer I'm sold on. Especially as someone with temperamental skin. 

Another great thing about it is that you can try it on at Ulta, Sephora, Macy's before you buy so you get the right shade, and they're also returnable if you're wrong. And (I'm really fair skinned and acne prone but I also recommend it to a friend who is really dark skinned and acne prone) and the original foundation is light reflecting and comes in a wide range of colors that should work for you. I'm kinda in love with this make up. ,2,2,0
In general, BareMinerals didn't work because it slicked off easily and didn't apply well. I don't recall it breaking me out though (and I've had bad acne). 
Anything that specifically says oil-free has worked out well in the past for me. Try Clinique, Lanc√¥me, or Smashbox if BM doesn't work. ,1,1,0
I love it. Doesn't break me out at all and has good coverage. The primer helps and the mineral veil is an essential part of the kit because it keeps the oiliness down. If you have fair skin skip the matte foundation and go with the original (matte turns fair skin orange). ,1,1,0
I love it! Didn't break me out at all and the color matched perfectly. Not for covering cystic acne though. Great for post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.,1,1,0
bare minerals is great for spot concealing too. It sometimes sticks to my dry spots, but it stays there all day and it great for coverage. Also has spf in it!,1,1,0
Yes.,1,1,0
I don't wear makeup, but I do know that in middle school my mom bought me this brand because of my acne. Apparently from what she read/knew, Bare Minerals was supposed to be the best for troubled skin. I don't really remember how well it covered my pimples or if it effected my skin at all because I was too young. I stopped wearing it after 8th grade because makeup just isn't my thing. Plus, this was in like... 2009. 

I'm sure other people have better answers lol. ,0,0,0

Is your skin dehydrated, causing itching ?,1,1,0
Hi guys,
I am currently experiencing issues with redness and acne on my face.

My routine: cleanse with a gentle/basic cetaphil wash, vit C (AM) , Tretinoin 0.05% (PM) and then moisturise with hada labo gokujyun and aveeno daily moisturising lotion.

The hada labo lotion was a recent addition as I felt that I needed more hydration in my routine. I have started to taper off vit. C in the mornings too.

I am currently on my 3rd month of Tret, and I feel like I am experiencing a 'second purge' atm. I experienced a small breakout initially (i think redness and pimples came up more) and that then subsided for a while, til now where I am again experiencing some kind of purge. My cheeks have gotten redder and I feel like I have more CC's.

Initially I only used tret 2 to 3 times a week, and by the end of month 1, I was doing it almost nightly, where only now did I choose to taper off and reduce the frequency. I am also planning in buffering with the hada labo lotion prior to tret. application.
Should I wait a few more months longer for some progress? I've also restarted taking some doxy to combat the issue or any inflammation (if it even helps).

Thanks!,1,1,0
It's good that you're using cetaphil as that's gentle on your skin. As for your redness, I don't think vitamin c and other creams is likely to bring that down, as it's inflammation from your acne. 

Tretinoin at that strength won't do much for acne (although I don't think you're skin looks as bad as you probably do).

The only real way for you to effectively treat your acne is through a dermatologist, and medication like isotretinoin (accutane). Acne is over productive sebaceous glands, that's what causes the inflammation from the blockages. Avoid antibiotics, as they only treat the secondary infection, not the root cause of acne. 

If you do go to a dermatologist (which I recommend) and ask for accutane, just over exaggerate the emotional stress. My skin was milder than yours and I got it. Best decision I ever made. 

Good luck! 

,1,1,0
No, they are surprisingly common. It is based on a build up of keratin in your skin. If it really bothers you try cetaphil soap. I was given it by a dermatologist back when you needed a prescription. I had this growing up and still have it a little bit today. ,7,7,0
It's called KP, keratosis pilaris. It's a buildup of keratin in your hair follicles. The treatment is some type of exfoliating moisturizer, I like amlactin or alpha hydroxy, both eat away at dead skin and resurface skin. Also using a loofah or something similar to gently exfoliate in the shower may help as well. ,4,4,0
I have the same issue and use a Stridex pad every other day, it helps!,2,2,0
Ive had the same thing my entire life - I recently cut out all dairy and seriously noticed a huge difference in the spots going away. I didn't think much of it, until I started using my protein powder again (contains whey) and they came back :/ definitely recommend trying this. ,1,1,0
You should try a lotion with lactic acid in it. A favorite for KP is Amlactin. It cleared mine up after about three months and I had it way worse than you.,1,1,0
Try African black soap. ,1,1,0
I got these on my arms too! I found that the only thing that worked for me was a really tough physical exfoliator, which also made the skin on my legs SO much better. Since it isn't acne, no acne products worked on it for me, and whether the soap was for sweaty or sensitive skin it didn't go away until I used a good exfoliator. Loofah's and body sponges helped, but I noticed as the exfoliator got tougher my skin got clearer. I use the Dermasuri deep exfoliating mitt, its 20 bucks from amazon. :),1,1,0
You should go see a dermatologist! The sooner you go the better I'd say ,3,3,0

Doxycycline is used to treat bacterial infections in many different parts of the body. It is also used to treat pimples and abscesses (usually on the face) that are caused by rosacea, also known as acne rosacea or adult acne.

[Doxycycline](http://yourmedicineprovider.com/?lang=en&cur=USD&a=78272) delayed-release tablets and tablets are also used to prevent malaria and treat anthrax infection after possible exposure and other problems as determined by your doctor.

Doxycycline belongs to the class of medicines known as tetracycline antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, this medicine will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.,1,1,0
This is WAY too light for Accutane. Accutane can have serious side effects and is really only recommended to people with severe/cystic acne all over their face. 

What helps me in that area is just making sure you keep oil away since your hairline causes a lot of oil there. If you feel your face getting oily throughout the day, wash your hands and then rinse your face with warm water and pat it dry. Make sure you wash your face every morning when you wake up and every night before bed. Also, sleep on fresh pillows! Wash them every few days and flip them to the other side after one or two nights use.,3,3,0
Go to the derm. There are accutane alternatives for people with light to moderate acne.,3,3,0
Yo. I have light to moderate acne. I wish I hadn't put off going to the dermatologist. What my Dr put me on is working well after only 2 weeks (still feels like an eternity). I thought topicals were BS but retinol and azelaic acid has been the secret to fixing my face so far.,2,2,0
Thank u Guy's for the kind help i Will plan an meeting with my doc (again) when he comes back from his holiday in the mean time I will wash my face and clean more often my pillow. ,1,1,0
What is your skin care routine? Am I wrong, or, as I can see in the photos, your skin is very dry? That's not a good thing.,1,1,0
[removed],1,1,0
I had trouble with my skin until I learned that washing with soap dries your skin and it responds by producing more oils. I switched my routine and haven't had a problem for years. I wash at night with the skin cleanser Cetaphil and in the morning I just rub water on my face and pat dry. If there's a time during the day like after walking my dog or going to the gym when my skin feels oily, I just splash some water and pat it dry. Good Luck!,1,1,0
A couple of things I would suggest:

- Are you using a moisturiser? If not I definitely recommend this 10000% over, you need to ensure your skin is well moisturised to aid your skin healing and prevent your natural oils from being stripped away and then over producing sebum to compensate.
- I don't think it's necessary to use your clay mask so often, around once a week is better again due to stripping oils since you are also using salicylic acid which can be drying if you aren't replacing the oil you take away.
- I would definitely suggest you at least change your pillow case more frequently, if you really can't be bothered you can get 2 uses out of a pillow case if you sleep on one side or if you don't have heaps of pillow cases just grab a clean tshirt and wrap it over your pillow and change it every day. When you sleep on the same pillow case the oils rub off from your face and absorbs into the fabric and just sits there oxidising which is not what you want rubbing on your skin. Make sure you are clean when you get into bed and you should be fine to change your bed sheets around 1 - 2 weeks.
- Change your towel more frequently too, every few days should be fine but let it dry out properly between using it.
- in regards to shaving, is it an option for you to just trim for a while and see if that helps? You will also be able to tell if it is your shaving cream in that case if your skin clears at all while not close shaving. Shaving can be pretty irritating to the skin unfortunately.,2,2,0

I'm a beauty therapist and I have had a lot of success with my clients who have monthly facials, the use of peels are really great for acne and scarring and micro needling is great once the acne stops for healing scarring and absorption of products. Aestheticians are allowed to sell skin care which has a higher percentage of active ingredients as opposed to products you can buy in the supermarket which have little to no actives and aren't very effective.

One thing I would advise is do your research on where you go, if they don't require you to fill out a medical history form with questions about your skin don't go back there. Check that they are fully qualified and are hygienic and professional. Facials are not something you want to cheap out on so avoid deal sites and cheap places. A really good internationally popular product range in spas is Environ which I personally have had a lot of success using that range and they only stock at reputable salons and spas so have a look who is in your area. The founder Dr Des Fernandez has written some amazing books about skin care and Vitamin A and he has been around for a long time, I recommend everyone to look into his studies.

Also remember that a lot of them are paid commission to sell products to you so don't feel pressured to buy stuff on the first session, wait until about a week after your first facial before you decide to buy products and do your research. Also most reputable brands don't have their products available on retail shelves or online as their products are effective but can be damaging to the skin if selected incorrectly for your skin type - they are intended for a professional who is trained in the ingredients of the products select them for you to suit your skin best.

Good luck and have fun having facials because they're so relaxing!,3,3,0
I've had a lot of clients have success with peels!  I send them to another gal who is very passionate about skin care and is way more experienced .  Do your research on your local spas!,3,3,0

I bought an acne soap that's only generic but it works well to me. I also tried applying apple cider vinegar daily. Bacne is usually caused by leftover from your shampoo (it flows from your back when rinsing) so it will really make a difference to rinse your back well.,1,1,0
How old are you? Do you get acne on your face? I had horrible acne from about 17-22. Cystic hogs who left their mark to this day. I used apple cider vinegar and it helped a little for me, depending on the severity, I'd give that a try!,1,1,0

Swimming in the ocean with the combination of sunlight (in moderation) drastically cleared my skin. Can't say the same about epsom salt baths. Don't take my word though, I was not persistent with the baths like i was with the ocean. Best of luck!,4,4,0

Time will reduce the scars but you are stuck with them forever.,1,1,0
Acne can come about for a ton of different reasons. Stress, hormones, and so much more. When first trying to treat acne I recommend over the counter acne treatments first. I would try salacilic-acid‚Äã and benzol peroxide, and if that doesn't work, retinoids. When you are using these treatments be sure to use a moisturizer. They tend to dry out skin and dry skin can make acne worse. ( You should use moisturizer even if you don't use these treatments). Just give it some times to go away and if it doesn't I'd consult a dermatologist. ,3,3,0
I recently started using Aloe Vera on my face the clear kind it has thinner ¬øleaves? and it helps with the healing of active acne. Also use a sensitive skin face wash. And maybe use a spot treatment on active acne, tea tree oil works for most or benzoyl peroxide, potato works too like raw potato. ,1,1,0
Slap a hydrocolloid band on it. That's going to help the healing process without drying out your skin.,1,1,0
Okay, what else are you using other than the acanya? Salicylic acid toner/aftershave?

What are you doing for those razor bumps?

Try a little bit of hydrocortisone ointment for the cheek cyst.,1,1,0
is it only on one side? do you hold your phone agaisnt your face? they are covered in acne causing bacteria,1,1,0
could be a million things. Start with taking processed sugars out of your diet. ,1,1,0
Although SA has seemed not to work for you in the past (not sure what you used), Stridex in the red box might be worth another try. It does not contain alcohol, and I find that, while it is drying and can be irritating, you can squeeze out some of the liquid on the pad and only use it once per day, followed by moisturizer. 

It doesn't seem like you have too much active acne, just scarring. Maybe also try an AHA. I use Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion (10% glycolic acid) every 3 days, and have noticed reduction in scars. Buy a good sunscreen too!!!

It seems like Niacimide + Zinc and Azelic acid may help with scar healing as well. Im waiting on my shipment now :),2,2,0

I was on accutane twice, the second time for a longer and higher dose as the dermatologist said it would definitely work second time round - it never. Had acne for 15 years and now I'm finally seeing slow results doing it DIY with healthy eating, supplements and less stress. Drinking kefir daily has helped a lot. Listen to Brightside Ben (Ben Fuchs) he has some interesting perspectives on acne - it's not a skin problem it's an internal problem and also the healthy gut girl podcasts as they say the skin is a reflection of gut health. Let me know if you have any questions, I've tried a lot of things over the years. Listen to your skin, if a product is hurting - stop using it. Find something gentle and heal your body from within, it's what is working for me anyway but it takes a while,1,1,0
Birth control really helps mine. I was on Accutane as well, about 6 years ago..   I feel the only way I can get acne to stay away is with the bc pill. Still have a little but it definitely is million times better than in the past. Not as clear as right after Accutane, but still pretty good!

I feel like my skin is worse that anyone I've ever seen. But I wonder if I got as close to other people as I do to myself in the mirror, I might notice more imperfections. I've also had kids say 'What's wrong with your face', 'What are those holes in your face?' (acne scars). I've even heard myself described by adults as 'the girl with the bad skin'. Ouch!! 
But at the same time, I'm a teacher of 17-18 year olds (mostly Chinese and Nepalese) and I'd say 80% of them have acne. It doesn't affect how I feel about them- their intelligence, their personality and overall attractiveness. In fact, often the one's with perfect skin can be a bit vacuous and dull. I wonder if people work on other parts of themselves to compensate for their perceived 'bad' skin.

Man, I wish I could say "don't worry about it" but I've personally canceled plans and have chosen not to go anywhere because of my skin. That's no way to live.

("wtf ur saying") haha yes like because of acne i concentrate on my study and start reading books and learning other languages "like English" because I have so much time and try to be nice with peoples and many other good things believe me ... you just have to accept that you don't have choice but living with him until he goes and then we gonna Fuck the worlds hahaha... hey acne let tell something "if you don't give up easily I don't give up ever ;) ",3,3,0
I can really sympathize with this. Back in middle school and high school i didnt go anywhere because of the fear of being judged of my skin. Now i regret it because i dont have any memorable memories or didnt form any bonds. Bad skin does not stand between you having a normal life, unless you let it. ,2,2,0
I've been in a similar situation for a while. I went to a farmer's market and as soon as I walked up to each booth, everyone tried marketing organic products that would (according to them) clear my skin. Like yeeeeah, I don't think rubbing a tomato or honey on my face will help. It sucked knowing the first thing they saw and the only thing they focused on was my acne, not that I was genuinely interested in their products for entirely different reasons. 

I'm a female as well and within the past 8 months I started getting terrible cystic acne everywhere after never having acne before in my life - so it's been a huge challenge for me learning to live with it. I find what helps me the most is having a game plan to try and manage it and make forward progress and just finding ways to laugh about it. I had to walk away from the lady that tried selling me the honey because I was laughing too hard at the idea of smothering my face and back in honey. 

On another note, if you're having these painful cysts, I'd recommend seeing a dermatologist. I tried treating it on my own for months and it just seemed to get worse, until at least 50% of my face and back was either cyst, inflamed, or an open wound. My dermatologist started me on .05% tazorac gel for about 6 weeks, along with Cerave facial cleaner and I haven't had a cyst since - it's all been little black and white heads at the worst! I had my followup today and she has me continuing the tazorac gel and cleanser, but added a cerave moisturizer and a topical antibacterial to get rid of the little red circle scabs where acne once was. I've been on it for 2 days and it's already helping (they should be completely gone in 3 more!!). But if I didn't go to the doctor I'd still be suffering right now so if there's any way at all you can do so, I'd highly highly recommend it. And if you can't, the Cerave stuff is available at Walmart and Target and in and of itself might help you! Additionally, I just started Yaz so fingers crossed on that.

I use Nizoral and this is how I get it on my scalp only. Wet hair. Then I part it in the middle. I dab my fingertips in the shampoo, dab that into the part and repeat this for right and left hand partings. I dab shampoo around my hairline then with product on my fingertips reach into the middle of my head and massage my scalp till it's foamy all over. 
If your stuff is liquid I recommend getting a bottle with a long nozzle and dripping the solution into parted hair ,4,4,0
I'm not sure, but making your hair wet might help it stop it from soaking up all the prescription product (, since it's already wet).,3,3,0
Buy an eyedropper and use that to deposit the liquid directly onto your scalp. I do this in rows across my entire scalp. You can then rub it in with your fingers.,2,2,0
It also helps to have someone else apply it. They can easily part your hair and get the medicine to the hair's roots.,1,1,0
Take fish oil, it reduces inflammation. It has helped me so much with my cystic acne takes a 5 days to a week to see a difference. ,3,3,0

It also may be that the salt water kills the bacteria. Also, the lower altitude has a higher concentration of oxygen and so that can also help kill p. Acnes bacteria ,7,7,0

I have experienced this too. Have been spraying sea salt all over my face for the past few months. Has kind of the same effect but I do still have some bad periods though. ,1,1,0
Sea water is great.. although I think the ocean itself can't really be replicated with sea water tonics, didn't help me at all.. maybe it doesn't have the same minerals,1,1,0
I've had the same experience at the beach. I attribute some of it to the tanning but a lot has to with the sea water. You can make sea salt scrubs by mixing it with coconut oil, honey or water. Those should work better than the ocean because they don't have bacteria.,0,0,0
For the scars, if they're indented, unfortunately other than a medical procedure there is not much that can be done other.

For the red spots, it is completely normal post Accutane. It actually heals on its own but may take a while. What'll help is preventing acne by cleansing twice a day and staying moisturized all the time.

Your biggest enemy would be the sun. If you're not wearing sunscreen, the red spots will get worse.

Now those were preventive actions that you need to take.

Going on to the treatments, usually a dermatologist would prescribe you a good cream to help with redness. I recommend anything like a facial oil or cream that contains Vitamin C.  I personally use rosehip seed oil. It's rated as one of the least comedgenic non essential oils and most nutrient packed. It's got a moisturizing effect as well. It also doesn't even make your face look oily when applying. It contains Vitamin C and A naturally. It contains Omega 3 fatty acids. It has anti aging properties. It's heaven for me and I'm currently using it with great results on my red spots.

Good luck.,2,2,0
doxycycline doesnt do shit except kill the good bacteria in your gut and make yoou break out even more when you get off it. tbh take accutane, i wish i never took antibiotics. ,2,2,0
Essential oils are irritants! I don't think any of them will help acne, except tea tree oil. You also must dilute them in a carrier oil to avoid damaging your skin. Edit: if you have access to rosehip oil, it's not an essential oil, it can help with scarring. ,3,3,0
Let me just say, you're blessed if you can find a product "Rosehip Seed Oil".

My ONLY issue currently post Accutane from 1 year, has been red spots. I'm shocked at how this oil within 2 weeks cleared up 60-70% of the redness. I'm guessing it's because of the natural Vitamin A and C. Also the Omega 3 fatty acids and anti aging properties.

It's actually a non essential oil I think, I don't know if you'll find it, but if you do, grab it!,1,1,0

Remove? You can gradually fade them over time but nothing is just going to make them disappear. 

Your best route is through supplements (ie. zinc, vitamins A, C, E) and drinking LOTS of water! Green superfood powders are also great; they're like an all-in-one supplement that can help with a TON of things, including acne and scars.,1,1,0
Me personally I cut out dairy, because it usually has large amounts of hormones in it and what not. It could be the yoghurt because some yoghurts contain a lot of table sugar (even though you wouldn't think so). Maybe try a sugar free organic yoghurt instead. If you were already eating that, I'm not sure, maybe cut back and see what happens.,2,2,0
If you believe nothing else has changed (skincare routine, stress, hormones) it certainly could be the yogurt. ,1,1,0
Yes any sort of diary HUGELY affects my skin. other sorts of skin care still matter, but diary is a big factor along with sugar and alcohol,1,1,0
Why accutane only briefly? Might be time to do a full course.

Are you female? Before accutane you may try spironolactone. I had a horrible experience with it but most ppl on this sub who have tried it speak highly. Could be a solution. For me personally though, accutane is it.,6,6,0
I'm with you <3 same shit,2,2,0
Do you drink coffee? I'm going on day 20 of no coffee and in the first week my skin started clearing up. I caved and had red bull yesterday, but I'm trying to figure out if it's caffeine or coffee. Also check out the sub/AsianBeauty. They've got A LOT of skincare info. Anyways, wish you the best! I'm on the same quest myself ,1,1,0
I‚Äôm kinda in the same situation here. I‚Äôm 22 and I have tried many things to clear up my acne since my 15th. I tried literally everything you tried, except for accutane. Just don‚Äôt think my acne is severe enough to try it.

My skin has gotten better in the last few months. However, I still wake up with some new bumps and white heads every other day. 

I‚Äôm thinking of trying benzoilperoxide again since the last time I used it was about three years ago and that was for a pretty short period of time...,1,1,0
Same here, I'm replying to see if you ever find solution. Last week I got a suggestion to use the shampoo head and shoulders (the anti dandruff stuff) as a acne scrub. Hard to tell if it's working w/ the abundance of acne I have but I'll update you if I notice a change. ,1,1,0
I use glycolic acid scrubs. Is the only thing that's ever helped me,1,1,0
M/29 here. I overdosed myself with 250k IU of vitamin A a day. After a month I started noticing serious side effects (particularly brain fog) so I had to stop. Interestingly no dry lips or any of the other typical accutane side effects. I did notice less active sebaceous glands (normally I'm a slick) and much fewer breakouts. I'd say the effect was comparable to a very small ~20mg/day dose of accutane at which I'd normally experience absolutely zero side effects. So while it works, it's probably not a very good idea and I'd suggest you don't take large doses of vit A. I had tried smaller doses of vitamin A before but it had almost zero effect on my skin.

I tried ACV some 10 years ago. I don't think it's harmful in any way but it doesn't work. You can give it a try if you want to, but don't expect much.,3,3,0
im currently drinking a shot of apple cider vinegar and lemon with a glass of water every morning... its good for your skin. and i just got off 6 months accutane so i had a good dose of vitamin A lol ,2,2,0
Currently a certified medical assistant working in a family practice. We actually encourage a lot of our patients to take 2-3 cap fulls of organic apple cider vinegar (w/ mother in it) for a variety of things. We have patients who take it for their diabetes. We have one who states if she goes a day without taking it, her joints ache. We have tons who take it for their skin. You can mix it w/ honey or water it down to help w/ the taste. I also use it in my clay masks when I'm trying to really clean out my pores.,2,2,0
I am really sorry that the acne lesions are this deep. I think you'd better see a dermatologist and ask for oral meds. If you're not willing to take Accutane, then oral antibiotics are an option.,2,2,0
It looks very painful, I'm sorry. Have you tried oral antibiotics? I don't think anything topical is going to do much.,2,2,0

Sounds like we have similar skin. My breakouts span from my shoulders to the backs of my thighs and I get some blemishes on my chest occasionally as well. I'm 26 and have been dealing with this since puberty. I've found most OTC treatments to be tedious and useless, and most topical prescriptions irritate my skin. I'm on birth control, but whatever effect it has is minimal. 

I've found two very different methods to treat my skin. The first method is high maintenance and time consuming. I used the acne.org body regimen combined with a  clindamycin prescription. So basically, I would use the cleanser in the shower, dry off, apply clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide together, wait to dry (5-15 min), apply AHA+ lotion, and wait to dry (5-15 min). My skin really did clear up, but I grew frustrated by how much time I was spending on this routine. At a certain point, clear skin didn't seem worth spending so much time waiting for lotion to dry. 

I then moved on to my low maintenance method. I lightly wash with a castille soap, preferably one with some combination of tea tree oil, lavender, and oatmeal. After showering, I apply a homemade lotion that is roughly 1:5 tea tree oil to aloe vera. I only apply a small amount so it dries quickly, but it won't bleach fabrics if I were to put on my clothes before it dries. My skin isn't as clear as it was with the first method, but I prefer this low maintenance routine so much more. It's easier to travel with, and my skin is more resilient if I have to go a while without showering, such as for a camping trip. Honestly, it seems like the more I just leave my skin alone, the less breakouts and irritation I have. This routine is also way cheaper, so that's a perk. 

I would say try either routine, depending on your goals, lifestyle, and budget. ,1,1,0
Cetaphil has improved my bacne immensely. I still have a few breakouts here and there. I like to get a really steamy shower going, gently lather in on my back then turn off my water (conserve water) after it's been on my skin for 5 min i rinse off with very cold water. best of luck!,1,1,0
Raw African Black Soap might help

That does not seem to be any active acne (according to the picture). It's redness/hyper pigmentation. 

Benzoyl Peroxide will probably make it worse, I suggest using something with Vitamin C and/or AHA. ,1,1,0
scrap the st ives scrub, it's too irritating. you'll want a gentle cleanser- cerave and cetaphil are well known, good brands for this. and after cleansing, you'll want a moisturiser too- once again cerave and cetaphil both have awesome options. there are many other steps you can add in but if you get a basic cleanse and moisturise routine in action you can see if your skin starts to improve and go from there. 

if your skin is still bad, add in a topical treatment like 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream. this goes between cleansing and moisturising, is applied all over acne prone areas and left to sit for about 5 minutes before moisturising. 

your routine can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be really. the only two really vital steps are cleanser and moisturiser- also try to use a moisturiser with spf during the day for sun protection (I use Cetaphil spf 30 moisturiser for acne prone skin) good luck! ,5,5,0
I've been using a different cleanser which also contains that ingredient and currently have no acne.. perhaps it depends on the individual as with diet/acne relationship ,1,1,0
PIE sufferer as well. Don't overexfoliate, and definitely don't use scrubs. It just irritates the skin further.

Rosehip Seed Oil is what so far, a little less than 2 weeks, cured 60-70% of the redness.,1,1,0
For me, it lasted around 2 months! :( Trust me, it gets a LOT worse. I was in tears some days and my husband had to comfort me. I was basically a hermit because I was too embarrassed to go out with acne all over my face at age 36. Just don't give up. I almost did a few times but I'm glad I didn't because it just all of a sudden cleared up and now looks great. I'm still dealing with some scarring, though.,2,2,0
It last about 8-10 weeks for me and I was miserable! I am so glad I stuck with it, though. My skin is clear and even the old scars are starting to fade. Give it some time and try to be patient! ,1,1,0
Thank you for the encouragement! I'll continue to see it through. It's only another month and hopefully I'll start seeing results. I've just been feeling extra self conscious because of summer classes and I wish I could just stay inside. ,1,1,0
There could be. I quit drinking coffee and other caffeine this week, at the same time as increasing my spiro and tretinoin dosages, as well as adding azelaic acid. So it's hard to know what helped. But I was so desperate to keep this from getting worse that I'll just stick with not drinking coffee.,2,2,0
I believe when it comes to hormonal acne, definitely if you're drinking a LOT; caffeine messes with your hormones. I only drink a few cups a week (if that), so I haven't noticed too much of an issue.,2,2,0

I'd say no, black coffee shouldn't be a problem. However if your putting cream and sugar in that could definitely be an issue.,1,1,0
I'm a 31 year old male that started using Mario Badescu to treat cystic acne at 29.  I have used the acne and glycolic cleansers and really liked them both.  However I also got the 3 pack of the buffering lotion, drying lotion ...cant remember the third but they didn't do anything noticeable when I was dealing with a breakout.  I would use the cleanser every day and the glycolic every 3rd day followed by CeraVe moisturizing lotion and it worked fairly well.  Definitely get on with Curology if you can, it's been the best at helping manage my stubborn acne and repair my skin.  Good luck!,1,1,0
I used to use their Buffering Lotion. It really did help with the deep, under-the-skin nodules. I would notice a difference overnight and by 4-5 days they'd be almost flat (compared to weeks or sometimes months). However, it's not a preventative treatment; it won't stop them from forming - only helps them go away faster. Due to that and the expensive price, I stopped using it.,1,1,0
Try differin and bp ,2,2,0
Make sure to moisturise if you're getting oily skin. It may seem like you're just adding more moisture/oil to your face but it means your skin will stop producing more oil,2,2,0
Salicylic acid with Aloe Vera https://www.amazon.com/STRIDEX-PADS-SENSITIVE-SKIN-55/dp/B000NURPIW

Ideal for oily skin and irritation. Just make sure you don't use harsh drying soaps prior to applying it. Use for 4-8 weeks to see results. Continue to use as a preventive measure afterwards. Leave the treatment on until you next wash your face.,1,1,0
DIET: Check out supplements like Fish Oil and L-Lysine! I know you mentioned natural sources of omega-3, but the body may need more than 1000 mg per day. Check with your doctor (specifically, a naturopath) to see if you have any hormonal imbalances.

If you stress out a lot, take Magnesium. Again, check with your naturopath to make sure that you have a magnesium deficiency.

I saw a video by Organic Olivia on YouTube and started taking L-Lysine (and the other two mentioned above). It's been a little over two weeks, and my skin has improved a bit. I used to have angry, inflamed cystic acne, but much of it has disappeared.

TOPICAL: MOISTURIZE. Get a non-comedogenic moisturizer that will properly moisturize. Never leave your skin dry, it will overcompensate with sebum to clog your pores. After every morning or night routine, check to see if your skin feels properly moisturized. It should feel smooth, plump and well-hydrated; anything less means it is dehydrated. I used to slap on a layer of moisturizer after washing and applying my acne treatment products. My skin wasn't properly moisturized, and it would get so oily after two hours. Since then, I've been moisturizing well with a moisturizing toner (Thayer's), moisturizer (Clinique), and a second moisturizer (Laneige sleeping mask) if necessary. My skin doesn't produce nearly as much oil anymore.

Use a gentle facial wash with a pH of 5.5. Anything above that disrupts your skin's natural barrier and will cause it to overcompensate with more oil. If you ever feel like your skin is squeaky-clean, cracked, or stinging after washing your face, you're doing it wrong.

You can help speed up the process with products to target acne. I personally recommend products with sulfur. It has worked the best for me, way better than benzoyl peroxide. Salicylic acid is also good.

Overall, be gentle to your skin so it doesn't inflame, and be patient. Don't stress over your skin. I'm sure you've heard of that, but it's so important in letting your skin heal.

I also recommend looking up Korean skincare. Look up Liah Yoo on YouTube, she's super helpful. Be knowledgable about your skin and skincare, and you'll eventually find a routine that will work for you! Good luck.,1,1,0
Maybe try drinking 6 cups of green tea per day. You could also try vitamin A supplements but I wouldn't recommend exceeding 10000iu per day. Try a low gi dairy free sugar free diet (I'm an 18 year old male and this hasn't affected my growth or anything). I also use benzoyl peroxide (brand is benzac) 5% when I have acne coming up and it tends to stop it before it gets worse, tea tree oil can also bring it to a head faster and then it will get rid of the pimple, however it can burn you skin, which will take about a week to heal. ,1,1,0

What moisturizer do you put on after the epiduo?,1,1,0
Skin barrier isn't but it sounds more like a reaction. Remember, our bodies and our skin are always changing. Always. What worked years ago may not now and what seemed gentle before may provoke irritation now.

Use as few products as possible. Don't use soaps. Don't use BP (it sucks for oily skin and ramps up oily a lot before your skin adjusts, which then makes you break out more as your skin has to deal with 10x the oil). Wash your face twice a day, morning and night, warm water only. Then apply this: https://www.amazon.com/STRIDEX-PADS-SENSITIVE-SKIN-55/dp/B000NURPIW and leave it on til you next wash, after which you will apply it again. Salicylic acid is a mild antibacterial, but not too harsh. It thins sebum, so is ideal for oily skin and breaks up keratin blockages gradually. The 0.5% version is least irritating but still effective and the Aloe Vera helps to prevent irritation and thus more reactive oil responses. Takes 4-8 weeks to work at its best, but continue using it afterwards as a preventive measure. Start off applying it once a day and then move onto two a day. When your skin improves, you can try going back down to one application a day (leaving it on preferably while you sleep).,1,1,0
Dont believe everything that you see on the internet. Your derm will know the best and accutane is safe if closely administered.,2,2,0
You've seen a personal Dr about it but have you seen a dermatologist?,1,1,0
Sorry the title is a little messed up, very new to reddit. I've been getting my acne under control but I don't know what these red marks are on my neck on both sides of my face. They are flat and seem to be like pigment under the skin and haven't changed in months.,1,1,0
Cut dairy. Drink lots of water. Eat spinach. Stay away from processed sugars and fried/greasy stuff.,11,11,0
I had huge improvements when I cut out sugar. Also, I started taking fish oil supplements, and I think these helped as well (I'm vegetarian though, so I didn't have any naturally in my diet.) 

Cutting sugar out is definitely tough, but has the advantage of actually making you feel really different. Less cravings, more energy, better sleep. Once you feel the changes for yourself, it makes sugar less appealing. ,3,3,0
Sorry but if you want to experiment you could try a food elimination diet and see if you get any results but most of the time there is no strong evidence to show a corelation between diet and acne.

This is a good article on the subject.

There are entire books, websites,  mountains of studies and even more personal experiences attached to these questions. The truth is for most people with a severe acne issue, an almost wholescale lifestyle adjustment is in order. It's not enough to eat this product, change this dietary habit, take these supplements or OTC ointment. Prepare yourself emotionally and mentally for this and you will go a long ways on the road to success. All the best.  ,3,3,0
Eat carrots. Watch the caffeine and alcohol too.

I don't take vitamins because so many of them have filler crap in them. Some people say to try zinc but I haven't tried it.

I used this cleanser for a while, it didn't really foam for me at all and it seemed to work the same regardless of whether I wet my face or not. ,3,3,0
I used the Cetaphil derma control face wash and have been super happy with it. I always wet my face before applying the soap-even though the soap is already foaming- but I never had any problems with it and it's worked great for me for about 1.5 years now,2,2,0
There is a correct way to wash your face.  First you massage the cleanser on your face as an emulsifier to remove the makeup off your face.    Rinse or wipe off. Then you use it as a cleanser massaging it for about two minutes before rinsing it off.  The second method is where you will see lather, if the cleanser can produce lather.   This is the proper method for cleansing at home.  It will remove all traces of makeup and dirt etc for you to tone afterward.   ,2,2,0
I use the Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin and i have always used the cleanser with a wet face and washed it off with cold water,1,1,0
I'm very disappointed with this wash. I was previously using the Cetaphil Cleanser (purchased from Costco) but didn't feel like it was strong enough to clear up my face.  I now use the Citrus Clear Acne Face Wash and for the first 3 uses, my skin felt so clean, especially after the very first use. The second night, even better. Its not strong like proactiv, which makes my skin so dry - its just perfect for someone who has acne like me, cause it keeps the zits away, and got rid of the existing ones that I had. ,1,1,0
"Ingestion of high amounts of preformed vitamin A for months or years - results from daily intakes greater than 25,000 IU for 6 years or longer and more than 100,000 IU for 6 months or longer - are considered toxic."

I don't recommend it and I do recommend a dermatologist as I suffer from chronic mild back pain since hypervitaminosis A increases bone breakdown.

This is going to sound weird, but for a while I used raw ACV or sometimes the Aztec Secret Clay Mask with raw ACV, and this seemed to work pretty well for me. Recently, though, I went to the dermatologist and she prescribed Retin-A and clindamycin phosphate-benzoyl peroxide gel. I'm entirely clear now. ,3,3,0
Drink more water. Get some clearasil cleansing wipes. Try not to wear hats and if you do wear a bandana under it. I had bad forehead acne before. ,1,1,0

That looks like cystic acne, highly recommend not touching it at all! Touching it will only make it spread.,3,3,0
Vitamin c never worked for me honestly. Whenever i used it, it always made it kinda darker.,1,1,0
If nothing is helping, you need to go back to the dermatologist and see if there are any other alternatives to accutane.,1,1,0
Agree that you need to see the derm again. Possibly need a higher dose of tretinoin cream. I got frustrated with the IB of mostly whiteheads that 0.025% caused and quit using it after 3 months. Finally saw a derm after 8 months and she increased my dosage to 0.05% tretinoin once daily and had me start azelaic acid once a day as well. Between that and my increased spironolactone dose and BC (both of which you can't take since you're a dude), I've noticed improvement in just a week of use.

Bottom line, see your derm and don't lose faith.,1,1,0
Could be. Give it time maybe?  And if no improvement, I'd say cut the stuff that yeast feeds on. Typically if you can cut out all sugar (including honey and even fruits), breads, alcohol, etc, you should probably see results in about 5 days. I have this problem too (forehead and upper arms) and I notice when I'm not careful with what I eat, it flares up. ,1,1,0
It looks like yeast...folliculitis. Stay away from sugars and breads. ,1,1,0

it might also be the water at your grandmas house, I know it sounds weird but when I travel I notice a lot of breakouts/ or the complete opposite, I think it has to do with the water?? ,4,4,0
This could be due to vitamin A, which you can overdose on in the preformed/animal form. I would talk to a doctor and make sure you're eating safe amounts if you're going to add it to your diet.

This is from Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A#Vitamin_A_supplementation 

>Since vitamin A is fat-soluble, disposing of any excesses taken in through diet takes much longer than with water-soluble B vitamins and vitamin C. This allows for toxic levels of vitamin A to accumulate. These toxicities only occur with preformed (retinoid) vitamin A (such as from liver). The carotenoid forms (such as beta-carotene as found in carrots), give no such symptoms, but excessive dietary intake of beta-carotene can lead to carotenodermia, a harmless but cosmetically displeasing orange-yellow discoloration of the skin.[39][40][41]

>In general, acute toxicity occurs at doses of 25,000 IU/kg of body weight, with chronic toxicity occurring at 4,000 IU/kg of body weight daily for 6‚Äì15 months.[42] However, liver toxicities can occur at levels as low as 15,000 IU (4500 micrograms) per day to 1.4 million IU per day, with an average daily toxic dose of 120,000 IU, particularly with excessive consumption of alcohol.[citation needed] In people with renal failure, 4000 IU can cause substantial damage. Signs of toxicity may occur with long-term consumption of vitamin A at doses of 25,000-33,000 IU per day.[1]

Honestly I have never heard of it and being sexually active did not help my skin. ,10,10,0
I've never heard such a thing, and without a few scientific studies confirming this hypothesis, I refuse to believe it.

Like, by what mechanism would this occur?  It makes no sense to me.,4,4,0
No, I don't believe so. I can't imagine how that could be true. I'm guessing your friends and relatives just believed having sex helped clear their skin because they began doing it around the time they were finishing puberty. If anything, my skin has actually gotten worse over the years (üòî) that I've been having more sex. ,4,4,0
I started my sexual life 6 months ago, I have cystic acne, it reduced, you can visually see the difference if it were to see me between the time before and now for example, this happened to me and a couple of other friends too, all with cystic acne. 


LE: forgot to mention, this did not happen over the night of having love, it reduced slightly in time. ,4,4,0
I just started having regular sex in the last two to 3 months, and I actually kind of think it made my skin worse haha? Or maybe I was just having an acne breakout and it was just the timing with the sexual activity that made it seem that way. I've also stopped having sex now (in the friend zone rip) and my skin is still getting worse, so it probably wasn't the sex haha. ,1,1,0
Probably sebaceous cysts. ,2,2,0

My acne was worst in college.

Go to amazon and mangage your acne with 2.5% BPO with the though in mind that as long as you keep your face a baceterial wasteland the less likely you are to breakout(not touching your face or wash off the BPO that you put on this morning).

Or what I prefer is using OTC adapalene daily especially on the problem areas.

I'm not gonna argue about diet but from memory I've read a few studies which show that a high CHO diet exacerbates acne yet most studies don't really show a strong connection between diet and acne.

Anecdotally the inflammatory nature of my acne was reduce when I taking fish oil and the number of lesions I had went down the more I slept and kept my teeth in pristine shape after a dental cleaning(oral health connection).,1,1,0
I never used acne products either. Once I turned 19 I started breaking out. I guess because of toxin buildup. I just started using sea salt and water. It's a lot more gentle than drug store let alone any face wash. Go one acne.org and look at some helpful tips people say about sea salt and water.

I remember this feeling approximately 1-2 months into accutane. It was almost 10 years ago but I still remember. ,8,8,0
Some scar and some don't. Almost all of my scars are from cysts that had blood in them. I get these when I'm detoxing. Its really hard to tell. Sometimes I've picked holes in my skin and not gotten scars and other times I've completely left pimples alone and ended up with dints.,1,1,0
Glycolic and salicylic acid peels are great. I had bad scarring on my back from acne and it lightened it completely.     
I'd do them at home instead of a clinic, much less costly. ,2,2,0
Yes. Chemical Peels are excellent choice for treating hyper-pigmentation.Peels work by exfoliating the uppermost layer of your skin and the dark area with it. There are many different types of peels and they are usually solutions that the dermatologist applies to the skin. [Chemical peels] (http://www.memphisskindoc.com/chemical-peels-dermaplaning/index.html) vary in depth and strength as well. Multiple peels are needed for maximum results.Most dermatologists recommend a total of 4-6 peels to observe maximal improvement. Peels are generally performed once every three to four weeks. Although peels are an investment in time and finances, they offer the benefit of improving hyperpigmentation and overall skin clarity.

Other options for treating scars include: microdermabrasion, [microneedling] (http://www.memphisskindoc.com/microneedling/index.html), subcision, and laser resurfacing.

It is always important to consult a professional for the appropriate skin treatment for your skin type.

I've tried Accutane, which basically is a Vitamin A supplement overdose to treat acne. A full course of 5-6 months typically cures it. The abundant amounts of Vitamin A in the drug attacks the root of the problem of acne, which is the sebum production, which is why I say it cures acne.,3,3,0
I have tried vitamin A for about two months daily. Unfortunately, I didn't notice that much of a difference. Zinc, on the other hand has definitely helped in regards to preventing cystic acne from popping up. I take 50mg daily along with a multivitamin. ,2,2,0
I did.

I followed guidelines from an old ass paper(1970s) on NIH that followed a group who did 100k IUs of retinyl palmitate daily for quite a while and another paper which said up to 400k daily didn't kill their patients so I went with 100k.

I did 2 short courses of about 1 month.

I would still recommended to do this through a doctor via accutane and monitoring your liver enzymes and tracking your symptoms.

The effect I got was quite a bit more potent than topical tret and my acne has reduced significantly in severity(went from moderate to mild) but I have to deal with mild chronic back pain now that I didn't have before.

Also if your acne isn't severe, Adapalene is over the counter nowadays and I would definitely try that or alternate that and topical 2.5% BPO on a daily basis if your acne is a little more severe.

TL;DR: If acne is moderate try OTC Adapalene, if severe please see a dermatologist for Accutane.

If adapalene was OTC back then I wouldn't have tried treating my acne via Vit A pills.,2,2,0

Hi guys, first time posting
I am really in a crisis at this time in my life; I'm starting to feel like there is no end to my acne problems. The picture above is a huge improvement to what is was, however somehow I feel like I will never have the skin everyone else does:( 
I really need some advice on my skincare routine because that might be the issue

My routine is:

Wash face with clean flannel and African black soap 
Oxy Cleansing pads 
Cetraben Emollient cream as moisturiser 

I occasionally use a tiny bit of hydrocortisone 1% ointment on any spots but sudocrem always has the best results for me
,3,3,0
That looks like hormonal acne to me, because the rest of the face is very clear. Have you tried hormonal solutions like going on (or off!) birth control pills etc? Of course, you might want to actually get your hormones checked first. ,3,3,0
You need to see your GYN and dermatologist to get a professional opinion and access to heavier duty RX treatment. Your acne looks a lot like mine, and I have hormonal acne.

I did a low dose of spironolactone and didn't see much improvement. I gave up for a few weeks and after my derm appointment this week, I'm back on it at a higher dosage as well as on oral contraceptives. Too early to tell if this is going to fix my problem, but it's what we are going to try before making the leap to accutane.

Do some research on contraceptives and what's good/bad for acne. You may want to discuss that with your Dr because maybe what you're using now is aggravating the situation.,2,2,0
Please go to the doctor and try and get them to see if any hormonal imbalances are causing this! I get very bad chin/jaw acne and last year was diagnosed with PCOS. I've been on Marvelon for a year and it has definitely helped. ,2,2,0
Omg! My acne used to be just like this since age 12. It was hormonal. I started birth control pills at 17, which helped a little. I was still breaking out, until I started spironolactone at 20. It is a diuretic that reduces testosterone levels. I took it for two years and I had clear skin consistently. I stopped for two years no problem, during that time I was able to take care of discoloration and pitted scarring. it's come back now and I'm on it again - breakouts stopped. 

You may want to discuss with your Doctor other options of birth control because some methods can actually cause acne. Also discuss spironolactone! It's been a life saver for me with minimal side effects (lower blood pressure, being thirsty, pee a lot)

I've been taking saw palmetto (DHT inhibitor), zinc and D3 for a short period of time, and so far it seems to work quite well for hormonal acne. I tried Spironolacetone and it seemed to make my face worse for whatever reason even after a few months- although it does work miracles for some people.

The PCOS forum has a few seeming solutions to androgen-based acne. (even if you don't have PCOS),2,2,0
I've had similar acne, mostly on forehead and chin. Differin made it even worse. I've purchased Cetaphil Dermacontrol Cleanser (also later bought Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser for future use), NIP+FAB Glycolic Pads, and Dalacin (clindamycine gel). I've used the cleanser twice daily and Dalacin after cleanser daily too. In the morning I applied Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer with SPF 20-30 min after clindamycine. I've used Dalacin for three weeks and then incorporated glycolic pads into my routine (twice daily too but sometimes I make a break). I'm so happy, so far no active pimples and red scars have faded away. Try clindamycine, at least it has no side effects. ,2,2,0
Do you have oily or dry skin? All soap is evil. Moisturisers are always risky too. Acne or no, you still look amaze. ,1,1,0
Murad acne body wash helped when I had a little bit of chest acne.

Cut out the dairy. It can only help. I've been dairy free for several years and I am loath to think how bad my acne would be if I still ate dairy.,2,2,0
Can you post a picture of the skin? The best treatment depends on the type of scar.,2,2,0
Long story short it depends on the type of scaring you have. [This picture](http://static.acne.org/ipb_uploads/post-386516-0-84666400-1396070243.jpg) should help you figure out which types you have.

Rolling scars so far as I know can only really be treated with subcision by a Doctor. If they're raised silicone sheeting is an option. Ice pick scars are pretty notorious for being difficult to treat- even with professional treatment - but don't let this get you down, even Brad Pitt has acne scars. 

[Here's a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375771/) with photos of the results from tret and glycolic acid on acne scars. This would be an intense home routine, but it is do-able. If your in the US you will need a prescription to get tretinoin. And it will take a few months possibly up to a year to see results.,2,2,0
Get silicone fillers. Best thing I ever did.,2,2,0

Most will say to avoid the sun because it prevents healing and can lead to hyperpigmentation. But if you genuinely see your skin improving by being out in the sun then keep doing what your doing. I personally would rather use the sun block and have the ease of mind that the scars are healing better , but if you see them improving more with sun exposure go for it. Just make sure your tan isn't changing your skin color to match the scars and that's why your seeing improvement. That would mean the scars are not improving, but that your just hiding them temporarily and that would hurt you in the long run when you start aging.,5,5,0
It works but I think it highlights scars even more so I'd wear sunscreen ,1,1,0
I think the sun in general makes scars darker ,1,1,0
Moisturizers contain a lot of harsh chemichals, natural oils are usually the route to take. Argan oil is very good oil, one drop goes a long way...but my favorite has been sweet almond oil..it works in sensitive skin, and helps itchiness and flaky skin.,1,1,0
I've been using raw Shea butter warmed with my fingers after spraying rose water my face. Has helped so much with acne! ,1,1,0
Start drinking tons and tons of water. Eliminate dairy and meat. Eat a lot of raw foods and leafy greens, and try not to eat sweets/candy all the time. Watching what I put into my body helped get rid of the majority of my cystic acne. Also, getting rid of my store bought facial cleansers and spot treatments helped too. I now only take my makeup off with grapeseed oil or makeup wipes, wash my face with chemical free/natural soap, and use apple cider vinegar as a toner.,4,4,0
Differin is now OTC in the United States. So try that if you can. ,1,1,0
How long have you used it for? That's really the strongest OTC you can use. ,1,1,0
Cortisone 10 cream helps significantly reduce cystic acne. Had a huge one on my forehead 2 days of cortisone cream and it's barely there. Just be careful, I've read mixed reviews on prolonged use on your face ,1,1,0
Try buying strong, good quality Zinc and Vitamin A supplements and cut out dairy and refined sugar from your diet to lower inflammation. Drink loads of water. This helped me with cystic acne around my mouth and chin area in particular (hormonal apparently).

A good way to treat the acne is a paste using bicarbonate of soda and epsom salts (dirt cheap) with a few drops of water and apply to the area for 15 minutes and wipe away with warm cloth.,-3,-3,0
I also break out when stressed. Apply ice to the area to kill bacteria and blood flow to the infection for 10 minutes. Let it rest then repeat. This helps to avoid and help the blind pimples.

Once it's come to the surface and healing apply a paste: epsom salt and bicarbonate of soda with a few drops of water for 15 minutes. This will dry it out and sterilize and alkalize the area. ,2,2,0

Depending on the scars, AHA could help but it seems tricky as your scars are on your back and not your face...,1,1,0
Image also won't load for me :/

My advice would be laser treatment if you can afford it. It has made a huge difference in my scars. I also use AHA and do peels once a month.,1,1,0
Reducing inflammation will definitely help! Any tips on what to cut out or look out for in terms of sugar?,1,1,0
I wouldn't apply it to the whole area, just the pimple, as it can burn your skin and make it go red, which takes about a week to heal ,4,4,0
Just apply it on, it doesn't need to be rub it in. It should absorp quickly in the skin, if not try to pat it down.
Good luck with your sheets!,3,3,0
I just put a small pea sized amount on my finger and then spread it over the area. Takes about 3-4 pea sized amounts to cover the areas where I break out.

Don't just put it on the spots, cover the area around it.

If you are applying once per day I would apply it at night, around 1-2 hours before you go to bed so it has time to soak in.,3,3,0
wow.

Clinique acne solutions has been a great line for my skin so far. It's a bit drying due to the SA/BP but I just use a good moisturizer after. It's been the gentlest and had the best impact on my skin of all the (zillion) things I've tried these past few months.

ETA: I have very dry skin,1,1,0
Honestly I don't notice much at all. ,6,6,0
Honestly it sounds like more of a problem with your moisturizer than your sunscreen, but using sunscreen everyday is still a good idea even though you might not notice it,3,3,0
You should use it every day. Try to look into oil free formulas. I'm currently using La Roche Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid and it's great for people with oily skin. Since you are on accutane, you might be fine with a regular sunscreen that is much more oily.,1,1,0
Using it every day is important. You don't want hyper pigmentation among other things. I use Neutrogina Clear Face Liquid-Lotion sunscreen SPF 55 and it works well for me, but it sounds like you have super sensitive skin, so I would consult your derm about it since they usually have good suggestions. I wish you the best! ,1,1,0
It's crazy looking back and seeing how different I look without acne. I've struggled with it since I was 14-15 and just wanted to be done with it, so I just requested to be put on Accutane first time in at the derm and luckily got put on it. My acne was never as bad as it was in my first month, but Accutane pushes out all potential acne so maybe it would've gotten there!

I have a month left. Been lucky to have no side effects except dry lips. 

2months 40mg, 1month 60mg, 2 months 80mg. 

Open to any questions :) ,14,14,0
Your skin looks good now and you're naturally handsome, cheers! ,6,6,0
When did it start clearing up?,2,2,0
3 weeks is a very short time, you have to give it around 8 weeks to see improvement, and if you still don't see an improvement by that time, you'll have to try something else. Welcome to acne,6,6,0
Try removing all lactose from your diet. ! ,5,5,0
Be religious with your skin routine, even if it seems like there's no progress. Products don't usually start working fully until a couple months. For me, I was put on a retinoid. For the first month, I had the worst cysts as well as dry lizard skin.. but I still kept at it. After about 2 months, my skin had gotten significantly better. At month 4, I stopped getting so many cysts all together. Now, at a year, I only get one really bad cyst every month and a half or so.. sometimes none at all!,3,3,0
You just need to be patient. I got acne in my 20s (very little in highschool), and Ive been on tactuo. My derm stressed that I won't see results till week 12,1,1,0
Not dramatic at all! I'm 36 and have had to deal with it since my early 20's so I feel your pain. Some weeks, I only go where I NEED to go because I'm embarrassed. Luckily, I work from home. For us adults, it's usually hormonal. I have PCOS so that's where mine stems from. Diet is key as topicals don't really do much to help (at least, in my experience.....).,1,1,0
Have you seen a dermatologist yet? Not just a regular primary care Dr? Or even a urologist?,2,2,0
