My doctor recommended me going on accutane last year and thankfully, before I blindly took his advice I did a lot of interesting research by talking to people who had been on it as well as online research. What I found:
-yes it works, but at a cost to your body
-it has potentially very harsh side effects like depression, infertility & permanent damage to your organs
- there are so many simpler, easier ways to treat acne through proper dieting, emotional factors and environmental factors.

I completely cleared up my skin 100% by going on and sticking to a paleo diet for 6 months. What that means is no processed foods, dairy, grains, alcohol, or added sugars. 
Only eat meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts & seeds. And heavy on the fruits and vegetables as those are healing foods. 

If you need more information on this, please feel free to inbox me. I would be more than willing to chat and give you advice.

483130075120821_1243196105780877,"Sadly not everybody can have their skin cleared through dieting due to the nature of the acne they have. I wish I could have cleared my skin just by dieting. I have/had acne conglobata, it's much more severe than what most people in this group have. It persists actively until you're about the age of 40 in most cases, and is extremely difficult to treat using normal methods most of the time. I took accutane for 2 years, along with antibiotics and steroids. Here I am 3 years later, my face is mostly clear but my back is still pretty bad, thankfully only a few spots are active, it's mainly big scars or bumps where the acne used to be. The only reason I did accutane was because I could no longer sleep at night due to my acne, not because I cared about what I looked like, as in my eyes nobody should, self shaming is a horrible thing; but because the pain was so great. I would come home everyday with blood soaked shirts from my acne, I had gallons of hydrogen peroxide just to clean them. Do I regret it? Sometimes I do, but at that state I didn't have many options. To my knowledge I didn't have any bad side effects, my lips didn't even get that dry because I was constantly using them to play the trumpet. We'll see in the future though. 

HOWEVER, I completely agree. Unless if you absolutely don't have another option then yeah, I would stay far away from accutane, it's not a nice drug for your body at all.",Michael Skidmore,11/9/2017 18:00,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If they don't approve me or if my blood test are not in good conditions or if I'm pregnant they will decline me to take the pills.

Talk to your doctor that prescribed Lithium and share your concerns and show them your acne.  Maybe they will switch you to a different drug.  Meanwhile go see a clinical Esthetician who has worked with acne and can give you corrective facials and products.  You may need to also see a Dermatologist for some topical acne medications along with a good esthetic routine.  Good luck.,Esther Garces,10/16/2017 8:27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In my case before I started taking Accutane, I dealed with creams prescribed by my derma (B. peroxide, Retin-A, Epiduo), but they didn't work. I took Accutane and my face ended up clear. I had my ups and downs, but when creams didn't work at first, they worked after taking accutane. Nowadays my skin is acne free and if it breaks out once, creams control it well.

Don't listen to anybody who says you can eat what you want.  Your skin is an ORGAN and acne is a symptom of something funky going on on the inside.  That's why it's so multidimensional for ppl.  Food is your medicine!  Find out what your body is lacking, in addition to healthy topical ingredients.  Accutane may work for some but it's not worth the risk.  It's only OK until it isn't.   And the ""isn't"" only takes a second bc the choice to take it only takes a second.  I was able to cure my hormonal acne using a combination of topical and specific internal acndll natural protocol.

483130075120821_1197529297014225,"Duane, Salty foods and food high in iodides are the culprit in making acne worse. Below is a list of foods typically high in iodides. We tell people to not go crazy around eliminating these foods, just be aware of eating too much of them.

For example, we had a client who was almost clear. She then came into our clinic all broken out and we couldn‚Äôt imagine what was going on ‚Äì I asked her if she was eating a lot of seafood or seaweed. She said, ‚Äúwhy yes, I‚Äôm sprinkling kelp on my food every day.‚Äù As you can see by the chart, kelp has the most iodide of any food. We got her off the kelp and helped her get rid of her acne again.

Milk (and cheese) is another BIG culprit ‚Äì not only does it have iodides, it also has hormones in it that contribute to acne. Many teenage boys love to drink gallons of milk which is contributing to their cystic acne.

Health foods and supplements are not immune ‚Äì vitamins almost always contain some form of iodide ‚Äì it could be in the form of iodine, iodide, potassium iodide or kelp. Also, vitamins contain biotin and B-12 both of which make acne worse. Be careful with protein bars ‚Äì they often have potassium iodides in them. Whey and soy protein powders for smoothies can be bad for problem skin ‚Äì try hemp or pea protein powder instead.",Chris Dixon Warnick,10/11/2017 11:20,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I never got a single breakout while on that diet, which is why I'm fully convinced diet is the main cause of acne. Most skin care products are garbage and don't even work. They only treat the symptoms, not the cause. What you're putting into your body is the problem. ""Let thy food be thy medicine and let thy medicine be thy food"" - Hippocrates

None helped. I have been on Aczone 5% the last two and a half months it does help some it has made existing bumps significantly smaller, however they are still there and it doesn't prevent new breakouts. So I guess I'm just curious about what other things people have tried and what options are out there.

1.) My biological father had quite bad acne. Other than that, I am unsure because I don't know a majority of my biological family.
2.) My gut is an absolute mess. I have IBS and it has been getting progressively worse. Trying to find a diet to help it. It's a slow process.
3.) My menstrual cycle is very irregular. For a few months I will have periods like clockwork, and then they will be off and sometimes I will go a while without one. So far, birth control has only made the problem worse with my acne and given me issues anxiety and depression wise, as did Accutane.
4.) I'm in my junior year of high school and taking all AP classes. Pretty stressed.
5.) I do not take vitamins because they often irritate my bowel. 

I have since purchased the Tanda Clear Plus. It has done a decent job of managing my acne. It is not getting rid of it, but it is calming the redness, irritation and soreness. Overall, it's working out okay.

1. Can't change genetics so will battle with this your whole life
2. Mmmmm yes 90% of skin disorders is bad tummy. My suggestion no gluten dairy or sugars. Perhaps a parasite cleanse and bowel cleanse will help. If possible colonix is best. Add probiotics and cloraphil it will help 
3. Normalize hormones - best to see holistic practitioner 
4. Stress yes this is hard when going to school. Try to bring some balance and calmness maybe some meditation or yoga 
5. Add Efa omegas into your routine and a digestive enzyme with bile salts will help",Tamara Hughes,10/7/2016 0:38,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I agree with Tracey that you need to find the root cause. Cleaning up your diet of dairy, sugar, peanut butter and soy will help. Drink lots of water and take 3000 mg Omega 3s, 50mg zinc, and a dairy-free probiotic. Google foods high in Omega 6 (not 3) as Omega 6s trigger breakouts in acne prone people.

I think my take home message from this line of research is that acne prones might not want to overdo it on chocolate. The studies had subjects eating a pretty good amount on a daily basis. I'd tell people that the research suggests there may be a link between moderate/daily consumption of chocolate and acne. And that if they notice a connection between their own consumption and breakouts, that maybe they might want to avoid it. I'm hoping for a future study that also includes women - they purposely left them out of these studies to avoid montly hormonal fluctuations.",Kimberly Tyda,1/5/2016 16:57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Or you had microcomedones under the surface of the skin already that you irritated in the pore. (Some reasons kinda overlap). 

I spot treat post plucking, waxing, threading, etc with benzoyl peroxide for my acne clients and works well. Mind you they are used to topical application daily, so they avoid irritation.",Rachel Geschke,9/6/2015 10:03,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of my friends asked if she should put her 14 year-old daughter on it.  she said that her ex-hubby and son had used it.  I asked her if either her ex or son had had any gastrointestinal issues and this was her response:  ""OMG!  YES!  My ex almost died from ulcerative colitis last year!""

I currently have a client who has gone through FOUR rounds of iso, and her acne came back.  Folks like the concept that insurance pays for it.  But if you're paying for the rest of your life with horrible issues as mentioned above, it's just NOT worth it.
