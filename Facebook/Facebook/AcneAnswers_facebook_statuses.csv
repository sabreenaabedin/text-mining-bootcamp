So I found this product just now, uhm I know that it's always best not to have anything applied on face while acne is still in its active form (unless its a topical agent used to treat acne), but I noticed that some of whom I know just can't go out in public without covering those red spots (because yeah, acne can really really degrade one's self-esteem). So yeah, i just want to let you know that there's this combination of CC and BB cream (they call it DD cream which stands for dynamic duo). And one of its ""benefits for acne""(idk i got this from a youtube video) says: (copy pasted from site)

You might want to try and see if it works. and I really dont know if it really does or if it could probably worsen acne, i really dont because i havent tried it myself. but for those who really cant go out without makeup, this one might be a good substitute (based on youtube reviews) than your current one.

What works for others may not work for you because there are still other factors such as diet, level of stress, environmental factors, underlying diseases etc that may affect the production of acne. So as long as you haven't used up all your resources, don't give up! Don't lose hope. It may be costly, but you have to give it a try. Don't let acne bring you down. Try whatever that works, but take risks. And I also would encourage you to be knowledgeable about the do's and don'ts for acne. A basic knowlege of it helps a lot. So starting now, reflect on everything, start with patterns of sleep, on what you eat etc....and don't wait for other's opinion because everyone's different. and don't be biased by too much information because it might cause you to ""not try it"" and who knows, it might work for you. As long as you researched well that it wont do you any harm then, go for it. See for yourself. if it doesn't work then find another. Don't prolong your agony in waiting for the ""right answer"".

So a little backstory; I'm 23 almost 24, and I am FtM Transgender. During my first puberty I have no acne. My skin was always soft, rarely needed to use cleanser or anything. Perhaps a few pimples here or there. But all my life I've always had a clean face. Never struggles with acne.
I've been on Testosterone for 6 months now and I'm pleased that my second puberty hasn't caused any acne. 
However a few weeks ago I attempted my first shave. And the pictures below are the result of it. The first photo was from August 23rd (after I shaved) Second was from last week. And the third was taken just now. It looks like it only got worse.....the 4/5th picture was before this happened.
I've been told it's razor rash/ingrown hairs and that it should go away in a few days. Well it's going on two weeks and no change. My face became itchy, painful, and they turned into pimples and was able to pop them. I stopped trying to shave once this rash showed up. 

I've been washing my face with three different cleansers, using Vitamin E oil, Aloe Vera, face masks. Nothing has made it go away.....
School starts next week and I really wanted to clear my face up before then. I feel embarrassed, ugly, I don't want to take pictures of myself (I use to take so many selfies lol) I don't even want my partner to kiss my cheek or touch my face because I don't want her to have to feel my gross face. Is there anything you recommend? What am I doing wrong? 
I just want some answers...

Ive been taking Allopathy medicine for more than 4 years continuously, Ive been taking 1 Becadexamin Cap only per day for approx 6 months, but no permanent effect. As Acnes would just pop-up often because of exposure to Dirt+sweat, spicy/oily Food or Stress. So recently I have switched to Homeopathy to treat my Acne problems, plus I also use Acned fashwash each morning and Benzac AC, Tretin cream alternatively each night. I hope it works.

Note: I suggest that-
Do not use Doxycycline anti-biotic, please see and sign this petition:

I'm trying to find numerous answers to skin related problems. More so related to the medical side of it with etiology, the different stages of acne and how they are diagnosed, labeled and treated. 
1) At what point does ""normal"" teenage acne become more severe and what are the aggravating factors and indicators that it has progressed beyond ""normal"" ? 
2) How does a doctor determine if ""mild acne"" was aggravated by your daily activities as opposed to it being a natural progression of the acne ?
3) If a 17 year old has ""mild acne"" and less than 3 months later they have bleeding acne, numerous inflamed lesions pretty much everywhere you can think of , is that a ""normal progression"" of acne ? 
4) Again, if a 17 year old had ""mild acne"" and over the course of the next 42 months they are treated for acne vulgaris, moderate acne, inflamed lesions and pus filled cysts from head to knees on 10 separate occasions,  Sebaceous cysts having to be surgically cut open and packed . The whole time being treated with every medicine available at that time. With the doctors noting ""treatments have failed"" ""medications not working"" is that something that could be considered abnormal progression of acne ? 
5) Lastly, the 17 year olds acne goes on to be a lifelong issue with constant/near constant care and treatments for 30 years and they have other skin issues that eventually are diagnosed by various medical professionals: cystic acne, sebaceous cysts, pilonidal Cysts, Nodulocystic acne,  Furunculosis, Folliculitis, Hidradenitis suppurativa. Are these all related to and a normal progression of acne or are these symptoms of a more advanced stage than mild acne ?

We always stress the importance of checking out what ingredients are in your make-up but we know it can be tricky. So, we went ahead and created a list of ingredients to #STAYAWAY from when buying your favorite foundation or trying that new pastel pink matte lipstick.  üíÑ

                                                                                                                                    
You can check out our FREE pore clogging ingredients list here ‚Üí https://goo.gl/4FOMgG

                                                                                                                                             
This is a go-to list that you can use to make sure you aren't using products that trigger your acne. Even if it's not make-up it will pay to check out the ingredients of your favorite products as a precaution!

483130075120821_792571770843315,"Hello everyone! thanks for the add! little bit about myself. I never really had a problem with acne much in my life, few blemishes here and there. But when I do get pimples, I get them really bad, and get them in weird places. I am FtM Transgender and want to go on hormones in the future but Im trying to learn and practice good skincare so I can prepare myself for a second puberty that may cause me to get a lot of acne, since it is common with most trans men. Thats one of my concerns with the hormones. anyway...
One thing I CONSTANTLY get is what I believe to be nodule pimples. Which are hard round balls of whatever they are under the skin about the size of a pencil eraser and they stay there from a few days to a few weeks. Rarely a month or two at most. they can be red, shiny, and painful to the touch. I first got them on the inside of my ear when I was 16 or 17, then started getting them on the side of my nose. Now i mostly get them on my chin. I can't pop them unless I spend a couple of days picking at it. and really try.
I had gotten one (sorry if this is TMI)..... on the side of my labia which REALLLLY freaked me out at first, but as i did some research i learned it was just another one of these pimples and online they said to put heat on it to it and it would go away. So i would sit on a heating pad each night for a couple hours. and after 2 days i felt it getting smaller, and 2 days after that it was gone. So I had a giant sigh of relief after it was gone.
Just this morning I had another ones of these pimples on my armpit. Again, freaked me the hell out but as I looked at it, its the same size as all my other pimples that I've had on my face, I just feel it more since its on thinner skin, (in compassion to the chin or ear), it was red and shiny, and painful to the touch. So I am currently sticking a heating pad under my armpit and will do that for a couple days until its gone.
Anyone else have these types of pimples? I hope this is the correct term for these pimples. I can provide pictures if that helps any. And how can I keep them from appearing? and is there anything else I can do to make them go away faster?",Colby Patrie,5/30/2016 11:47,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Study: Dark chocolate exacerbates acne

Int J Dermatol. 2015 Dec 29. doi: 10.1111/ijd.13188. [Epub ahead of print]

Abstract

The effects of chocolate on acne exacerbations have recently been reevaluated. For so many years, it was thought that it had no role in worsening acne. To investigate whether 99% dark chocolate, when consumed in regular daily amounts, would cause acne to worsen in acne-prone male subjects, twenty-five acne prone male subjects were asked to consume 25 g of 99% dark chocolate daily for 4 weeks. Assessments which included Leeds revised acne scores as well as lesion counts took place weekly. Food frequency questionnaire was used, and daily activities were recorded. Statistically significant changes of acne scores and numbers of comedones and inflammatory papules were detected as early as 2 weeks into the study. At 4 weeks, the changes remained statistically significant compared to baseline. Dark chocolate when consumed in normal amounts for 4 weeks can exacerbate acne in male subjects with acne-prone skin.

No idea why I thought this, as now I'm breaking out severely. My skin is ten times more oily, and I've noticed my hair become way more greasy than it has ever been so I tied that to the hormones and me getting off Nuva ring.. I've tried a number of different toners/washes/creams/spot treatments.. I recently bought a mini tub of glycolic acid which made me break out so much more.. my acne are like knots/cysts, very paintful.. last a few days and are swollen, other acne is regular blemishes, but throughout my entire body. I've also had knots elsewhere than just my face. Thank you for the helppp",Audra Bukauskas Odie,3/7/2015 0:15,3,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0

It had mostly disappeared from shoulders and back, but it wont stop on my neck. I have been on numerous perscriptions per my dermatologist and she's now decided theres not much else she can do. She said steroid acne is not something that can be fixed like regular acne. If I cant get it completely gone I at least want it manageable.

Acute psychosis induced by isotretinoin.

Abstract
Isotretinoin is used for the treatment of severe acne. Psychiatric side-effects, particularly depression, have been well-documented. This dramatic case report is about a young male patient who developed acute psychosis within a few days of starting isotretinoin. Due to his persecutory delusions, the patient, who was an Indian engineer working in Germany, decided to immediately return to India fearing for his life in Germany. Careful history taking established the cause of the psychosis. Isotretinoin was stopped; patient showed rapid improvement, within a week, on a low dose of risperidone. Risperidone was continued as a precaution for 3 months. After a further 8 months, the patient remains well without any psychotropic medication.",Kimberly Tyda,10/16/2014 15:41,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

what moisturizer, or way to moisturize, do you recommend for combination to oily acne prone skin?

i used one from BIODERMA, for combination to oily skin. useless, my skin would still get super oily. this brand was recomended by my dermatologist. 

i then tried the ""oil & blemish collection"" from John Masters Organics. seriously, utterly useless. my acne didnt get any better and i would still make loads of oil. huge, massive disappointment.

i then went back to the bioderma one. same thing. 

now i am using the Cosmetic Lad from LUSH Cosmetics. another massive disappointment. i got a sample from the Vanishing Cream, also from Lush, same results. oil, oil, oil, oil!

i mean, i just wanna scream! i apply the moisturizer and literally, just after 5 minutes, i can already see the oil on my forehead!!! 

i cleanse my face every single day and i exfoliate my face 2-3x/week. the cleanser is one from Bioderma as well, i know it isnt good, but i didnt know better then. i still have the cleanser from John, i will use that one after i am done with this one. i exfoliate my skin with organic sugar and honey and some lemon juice.  

i was reading about people who make a mix of EO's with great results. any tips? 

all i want, is to look at myself after 5h and not see my forehead and nose SHINING. thats my goal right now. to find a moisturizer, or way to moisturize my skin that will keep the oil under control. but i guess i need help.",Jo√£o Gabriel Santos,8/7/2014 17:39,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

as you may realize, i am acne prone. i have combination to oily acne prone skin. 

i have been reading about milk/dairy not being good for acne prone people. well, i dont drink milk, but i do eat natural low fat yogurts on a daily basis. it is said that yogurt helps acne, to get clear skin... but it's dairy... so, there is this ""contradiction"" here.

i do homemade facial masks and every time i go to the beach i use natural greek yogurt + raw organic honey (and sometimes i will add a mashed banana and/or a mashed avocado) to moisturize my skin after a long day under the sun. my skin gets very soft.

I run/own an acne clinic (http://www.facerealityacneclinic.com) where we have gotten thousands of acne sufferers clear without the use of prescription drugs, irritating prescription products or expensive medical procedures.
I have over 25 years of experience in helping people get rid of their acne. I have found that it's a process of using the right products for your type of acne; and using those products in the right way. Plus, a few easy lifestyle changes (and yes, you can have your chocolate) support your process. I will be posting some of that information here.
