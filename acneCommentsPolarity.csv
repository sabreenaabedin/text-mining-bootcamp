Go see a dermatologist.,3,3,0
I’ve had a dermatologist tell me that retinol was making my skin thinner. I stopped using it and switched to an oil-based cleanser and it resolved.,2,2,0
Retinol won’t do that to normal skin, but it’s different if you have an underlying skin issue. 

Still, go to a dermatologist for a proper diagnosis. As you’ve said, your thin skin is inherited, so maybe you are just aging quicker because of your thin skin. ,1,1,0
My mom has a thc balm (made with a bunch of oils) and I find it works alright. Mostly works well for putting on acne that's really sore and sensitive, after its absorbed I don't feel a thing :)
I haven't noticed much of a differece in size or anything but if it makes it hurt less that's cool with me. Haven't thought about using CBD for acne since it would be pretty expensive where I live. I'm imagining CBD would have a similar effect but everyone's skin is different so maybe it'll work well for you :),2,2,0
I use rosehip oil. It works wonders for my acne, plus aquaphor during the winter. ,1,1,0

Retin-A gave me a bad IB that was worse than what I had to start with. Once all that garbage was purged out of my skin, I was left with no new comedones and now my skin is healing up nicely. Worth it IMO but it sucked when you were in the middle of the IB. Best to just push through.,2,2,0
You’re already a few months into retin-A so you shouldn’t be having a IB at this stage. IB usually happens at weeks 3-12. 

Your skin is probably too dry and the breakouts may be from irritation and a damaged skin barrier. Dial back the retin-A to a few times a week, and moisturize like crazy. Or, stop it completely for a few weeks and work on bringing your damaged skin barrier back in a normal. 

I use aquaphor every night after my moisturizer. I use adapalene .3% and Aquaphor helps tremendously with the dryness. ,1,1,0
Adult acne is mainly internal therefore, drink more water, limit sugar, increase fiber and determine what foods you may be sensitive/allergic too and eliminate them ! It sounds tough but its worth it,2,2,0
I would use the teatree/witchhazel everyday, as prevention is better than cure. Acne is formed a couple of weeks before it actually comes to the surface (hence purging happens, when you increase your skin cells turnover rate). So if you’re only using it when you feel the breakout coming, it’s likely too late to stop it, although you may be able to make it less inflamed. Also make sure your tea tree is diluted!,1,1,0
My adult acne vanished 99% with my current diet and face routine.  
Face routine:  
 - Rinse face with warm water under shower (showerhead pointed to face), to open pores and clean them out  
 - Before leaving the shower, rinse face for 30-60 seconds with COLD water to close the pores up  
 - Stopped using any products.  
Food  
Spread out over my morning:  
 - 60g gluten-free cereal
 - 25g to 33g of dark chocolate (70% cacao or more)  
 - A banana  
Midday meal:  
 - Omelet of 3 eggs (sometimes with bacon)  
 - Cooked/baked/mashed potatoes (adjust to caloric needs)  
Evening dinner:  
 - Cook/baked/mashed potatoes  
 - 200g of chicken or more  
 - Broccoli (as much as I can eat in one sitting)  
Snack on coconut, avocado and banana. And in everything I cook I use a lot of olive oil to make it easier to hit my calories for the day. 
 I have basically tried to cut out carbs as much as I can, completely cut out gluten and milk products (I think I can't process gluten protein or caseine protein). I usually eat this every single day, sometimes I'll mix it up and experiment with other foods. But if I cheat and eat carb dense foods such as pasta (even glutenfree) I'll break out. Cheat on gluten once, and I'll break out.    
But you have to experiment and find out what makes you get acne. All of these products people use such as accutane just combat the symptoms of acne but not the underlying cause.,1,1,0
You live in cold, dry Canada and you’re not using a moisturizer? 

Make sure your skin is adequately hydrated. A damaged skin barrier results in more acne. 

I live in NE USA and the winters here are tough. I use multiple layers of moisturizer plus aquaphor at night. My adult acne is currently under control. Diet helps, but having a healthy, hydrated skin is key. ,1,1,0

Really? It seems to help me a lot with my acne. Have you tried fish oil supplement as well ?,2,2,0
I had terrible breakouts while taking fish oil, omega 3 and probiotics. 

I now just take centrum for women multi vitamin and have found this helps more than any specific oil etc ,1,1,0
Well there are some research showing a correlation between gut health and skin health. So probably the probiotics in kombucha are healing your gut, thus improving the condition of your skin. Kombucha isn’t terribly expensive or time consuming to make; all you need really is tea, sugar and water, as well as the starter which is called a SCOBY. It just might take you a few practice runs to get it right. It would be much more potent and effective if you make it yourself.  Best of luck!,7,7,0
I agree with the first comment.
When I had a slight infection in a broken tooth, my gums felt puffy and I began to develop more cystic acne that had previously been in hibernation. 
Once I went back onto antibiotics and spironolactone it subsided along with the infection. I do believe gut bacteria has a similar affect.

Edit: I forgot to mention that if you keep the original “scoby” or “mother culture” you can continue to make kumbucha. My old supervisor swore by homemade kumbucha as an athlete.,2,2,0
Vitamin C works for me! Just a topical serum.,2,2,0
PIE is supposed to go away on its own. but I think that’s only if you’re lucky :/ mine has been within me since I first started getting acne years ago. it sucks. the only things that’s supposed to be proven to help is laser treatments which can cost as little as $200 a treatment or even go up to a lot higher prices than that. some people see results with other things though like creams and silicone sheets. but idk personally I’m gonna go the laser route because i know mine aren’t going away  :/,1,1,0
I use the Aveeno targeted tone corrector! It takes about 3-4 weeks for it to become noticeable so I recommend taking more before pictures and then Afters in the same lighting ,1,1,0
Toner day and night??? AND differin? No wonder your moisture barrier is compromised. That seems a bit harsh to me.. If I did that my face would flake off it would be so dry!!   I would try toning once a day or every other day at least until your moisture barrier is repaired. I recommend you Try neutrogena hydro boost gel cream for extra dry skin on a freshly washed WET face ( morning or night or both it can’t hurt) and it will absorb all the water into your face and promptly seal that with your Clinique moisturizer. It’s like a double moisturizer method, I do this every day at least once usually at night. Hyaluronic acid applied on wet skin makes it most effective. The “acid” isn’t the kind that burns or Exfoliates in any way. It holds onto water molecules and makes your skin absorb them before they evaporate. Google it if you don’t believe me, but that will save your skin. 

Edit: I read up on the hada labor lotion and it seems to have Hyaluronic acid in it as well. I’m not as familiar with this product, but I have heard of the hada labo line. This still seems to be a toner which I have always used toners as pore minimizers and they always seem to be drying but this may not be the case with this product. I’m not sure how the hyaluronic acid would be effective in a toner versus a moisturizer. I still do recommend the neutrogena as it’s my favorite part of my skin care routine,and cutting back on any drying or abrasive acts you may be doing to your skin if you want to keep using the different as well. You are already being super abrasive with the differin so you can’t have other harsh ingredients in there with that too. ,1,1,0
the lotion is a light moisturiser tbh, you should be fine. ,1,1,0
Use aquaphor! It’s a magical balm for people on differin/tret or accutane.,1,1,0
Hello! This happened to me exactly how you described it. Unfortunately, I couldn't get back to the derm until after. People said it was normal but they're not the experts. When I went back after over half a year-- my derm said it was the worst thing she's ever seen. She's been in the business for 36 years. We don't have any idea on why it happened. Hopefully you can figure it out, but sadly, I think you'll have to live through it like me. Good luck and a thousand well wishes, I'm still living with the scarring from the mysterious reaction. ,2,2,0
the only possible reason I can think of for this is purging tbh,1,1,0
What's your diet and exercise regime like? Your body is purging something and you need to find out what it is and change that permanently. You eat loads of fruits and green vegetables and few fats or carbohydrates?,1,1,0
Drink green tea 2-3 times a day with have a great impact on acne,-1,-1,0
I break out on my forehead only when it’s from a product that clogged my pores or from food. Try eliminating dairy and bad fats for a few months. You need to try everything for at least over a month to allow your body to clean itself and start to see results. Source: my experience and dermatologist recommendation ,8,8,0
Do you use any hair products? Wear hats a lot?,3,3,0
I don't know what topicals might help, but using hydrocolloid bandages can at least get the zits drained with far less damage, which will reduce scarring, helps with the pain too.,2,2,0
Try Azelaic  Acid. You need to get it from a DR. Along with that shower and wash your face with sulphur soap. You can get it on amazon. Not only will it rid you of face acne; it will also help with any acne on your body. 

Also look into a Chinese face map. These maps are particularly useful for dietary changes.  Based on what you have, I think it relates to digestion issues. Do you have IBS ?

Hope this helps ! ,1,1,0
Do you have a list of foods you've been eating for the past 2 weeks?,1,1,0
I agree as well. I have been on the vegan diet for a year and a half and I have cleared up. I also recommend juicing as many vegetables (specifically green veggies and cucumbers) as you can. I juice this every day: 4 cucumbers, 4 sticks of carrots, an apple, a lemon, and also add 4 grams of vit C to this juice. Acne and skin conditions are NOT topical conditions, so why treat it with topical solutions? It's an internal problem welling up from the inside. ,6,6,0
I haven’t had meat or dairy since June and my skin is totally different. It’s the only thing that works for me. I highly recommend a plant based diet for those with acne. I do eat fish occasionally, it doesn’t seem to impact my skin. ,5,5,0
I️ have noticed 100% the same thing it really is all diet ,3,3,0
How much diary is too much? I only take about half a cup in coffee. ,1,1,0
I️ was a vegetarian for four years and saw no difference in my skin. You may be onto something about dairy in my case, though, but I️ am loathe to give it up because CHEESE.  Soy cheese is not worth the plastic it’s wrapped in. Yuck.,1,1,0
Add fish oil and zinc supplements if you can. It helped me too along with the clean diet
One girl mentionned soy the other day. I quit soy too 1-2 weeks ago. I got one 1-2 little spots but it was not execessive. I ate chicken a couple of days before that and goat yogurt (not cow's).

I'll update you after a couple of months of menstrual cycles. My skin is always different around my periods,0,0,0
What did you do? Did you just leave it on all night? It’s a face wash, not a cream. ,6,6,0
I'd make sure to keep it moisturized, as the salicylic acid can be very drying and damage your moisture barrier— even if the skin doesn't feel dry. Should help your skin recover more quickly. ,5,5,0

Whats your current routine, skin type, is this a recent problem etc.  Can’t help if we don’t know anything about your skin!,3,3,0
Looks like it's exacerbated by shaving!!! Consider an electric razor and starting with warm water so you open your pores,1,1,0
That’s what my chin looks like sometimes! If it’s the same thing as me, then it looks like you just constantly have new blackhead/hard pimple type things coming up one after the other??? 
If so, stridex pads helped me a lot with that. I use them twice a day, and it makes my chin a lot smoother. ,1,1,0
CHarcoal cleansers are know to “purge” the skin. You should give it more ham four days before you change because you said you never washed your face before and now you do. All that could have been under the skin and the charcoal brought it out. I would give it a another week. And then reassess the damage. In the mean time try a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment and use moisturizer after washing. ,4,4,0
Have you recently changed your diet? I know I break out like crazy on my chin when I either have a binge day or I eat a lot of dairy in a small amount of time. ,1,1,0
Look up caveman regimen before you get in too deep,1,1,0
Charcoal can make you purge. I'd probably drop down to using it once a day that being said.,1,1,0
These days doctors are willing to prescribe Accutane even for milder cases and also quite easily if the acne has been persistent and is not responding well to other medications, because the longer acne stays on your skin, greater are the chances of developing scars.,1,1,0
I think where accutane has such proven results a lot of doctors are willing to just use it as and when required. It sounds like you have your head screwed on firmly though so make sure you do your research/ask lots of questions before taking accutane as it is a 'last resort' treatment for a reason.
You can always request that your tries a different course of antibiotics first! ,1,1,0
Hey! I've got pretty much exactly the same problem as you, I'm 23 and my skin has gone to hell ☹️ 
I've been on several different antibiotics to no avail but I've found that Trimethoprim works for me (might be worth asking your doctor to change for something else, doesn't necessarily have to be stronger to be effective!) and change the topical treatment, I've used Differin, Epiduo and now Skinoren and am just seeing a difference now. It's all about patience unfortunately.
It might also be worth giving La Roche Posay's Effaclar range a shot for cleansing/moisturising as this is what my derm recommended for me (on their site it even says 9/10 derms recommend so it must be good!) 
Good luck!! ,2,2,0
I would start off by saying if your skin is kinda freaking out to just give it a break and keep your routine simple! Whenever I’m having bad breakouts I try to avoid wearing make up. I feel like it helps to get my skin clearer faster. 
definitely start doing a simple morning routine too. I use Micellar water in the morning and really enjoy it. Garnier and simple are both drug store brands that carry nice micellar water. I would also recommend to start wearing sunscreen. Cerave (another drug store brand) has an AM moisturizer with spf 30 in it so you’ll get two in one which is great if you have a hard time following a routine or you’re kinda lazy in the morning like me. ,1,1,0
Easiest option - Accutane. 

Or you can spend years and thousands of dollars on different products which may only provide short term and partial relief. ,0,0,0

Hi! I dont have any experiences with any of your prescriptions or retinol.. but i currently purging from BHA myself.. and when i said purging, it’s like all the ex-pimple i ever had, come to the surface again. 

I know how it feels like to have those marks, inflammations in your face, but be patient. Good things happen to someone who wait right? :) hopefully it happens fast to our face too.. keep smiling!! ,1,1,0
If you really feel like you tried everything, talk to your doctor about Accutane. It’s one hell of a fucking drug, but it really helps a lot of people. Don’t take it lightly. ,3,3,0
I'm taking Accutane right now. 40mg 2 times a day (80mg per day) and the side effects for me aren't to bad. Just dryness. Now it will differ from person to person. You do have to get your blood taken monthly, since it is really beating down your liver, it also means you can't drink alcohol in excess. You do have to see the derm monthly. Insurance will cover it if a bunch of cremes you've tried failed. If you are just jumping into Accutane without trying anything else, they won't cover it. It has been controversial because people have reported mood changes, and even suicide. I haven't experienced this (my skin is clearing up, how can I be mad?) but again, it varies person to person. Sorry for the shoddy formating and Grammar, I'm on mobile. Hopefully I answered everything I can for you! ,2,2,0
Can’t agree more. I wasted 4 years cause i was so worried about side effects and all horror stories of Accutane online. That was the biggest mistake in my life. So much lost opportunities and loss of self confidence due to acne in my pinnacle period of my life in my 20s. Side effects are jokes compared to what I got after the treatment.,11,11,0
Looking good man!,3,3,0
I did. Twice. Acne came back a year after the first round. And a year after the second round. Got tinnitus in my right ear from it, and couldn’t go back on it. It is now 8 years later and I’m still battling. :-(,3,3,0
Congratulations man! I'm getting jealous now 😂, how long is the treatment and how much does it cost? I live in Europe is there a thing like that here? Thanks,2,2,0
I was on the edge about it but I’m taking the plunge into Accutane very soon! Thank you for these before and after pics,2,2,0
I was so afraid of accutane that I’ve dealt with severe acne for 18 years. I finally took the plunge five months ago. Congratulations on your success!!,2,2,0
I've tried everything, including accutane. 3 times. Any other last hope ideas?,2,2,0
how much does it cost? im asian too, 26 years old and my face is as bad as yours used to be. ,1,1,0
I tend to agree. I did a 7 month course and it was phenomenal. Mine did come back after 3 years but much less severe because it’s hormonal.  if I ever need it again I would do it in a heartbeat. No regrets. I was ecstatic while on Accutane because it was the means to an end. Never was I depressed while on it. 
OP Your skin looks fabulous!!!! ,1,1,0
I have been fighting acne for over 5 years now. I'm 29 and over it. I have a phobia of getting my blood drawn though, so that has been holding me back from trying Accutane. The mental distress acne has caused has almost pushed me into a breakdown. I need to toughen up!!,1,1,0
Looks amazing! These before and afters are really keeping me going right now. I'm starting accutane in about 3 weeks, the month waiting period for women seems excruciatingly long right now. I've been resourceful enough over the years to be able to cover my acne enough so I don't feel awful, but I can barely look at myself anymore when I take off my makeup. I wish I had decided to start accutane sooner.,1,1,0
I've heard a lot about spironolactone. I think I will give it a try since I don't want to go on accutane. ,2,2,0
If it's a hormonal issue, you need to go to a doctor. Good luck!,2,2,0
While I agree hormonal issue is definitely something that needs to be addressed by a doctor, varies between people, etc etc, I too had an awful acne flair up after getting off BC. I actually also went off it for emotional reasons, so I feel your pain big time with this whole thing. I also tried fish oil, zinc, cutting dair and have a next to meat-less diet...all that stuff..it didn't do jack. I finally went on spironolactone and it helped!,2,2,0
It's pretty common for your skin to go haywire after coming off the pill. But the pill is also great for keeping hormonal acne under control. Having gone on it at 16 I didn't even know I had issues off of it. 
I'm already pretty healthy/vegetarian etc so pretty sure diet wasn't the issue. Benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics got the flare up under control after I stopped hormonal bc and my skin was perfect on them. Since stopping them its not perfect but not as bad as it was initially. ,2,2,0
Could be weeks-months. Exfoliating 2-3 times a week helps,2,2,0
Something like e45 or one of the cheaper alternatives? Simple moisturiser? Vaseline if place carefully could help? ,1,1,0
That’s where my acne would always hang out. After three years of every face product known to man, what worked was cutting out dairy and soda pop drinks. 
Took almost a month to clear away and even now when I slip up and eat cheese (god I love cheese) I’ll have a mild outbreak warning me to back off that take a week to go away.

My skin flared up super bad a couple months ago with cystic acne on my forehead and chin, it was terrible! I finally decided to go to a dermatologist and she told me after gently washing my face to apply a very warm washcloth to the pimple (not too hot!!!) Press moderately until it cools and lightly slide it across the pimple. It helps pulling out all the puss to the surface without breaking the skin how you normally would using your fingers. You can do this a few times every night to break it up. Don't ever pick at it!!! I used to do this consistently. After I started using the wash cloth routine, and stopped picking, it helped immensely ! 

I also started using a clay mask. Like the wash cloth trick, clay masks help bring up all dirt to the surface and clearing your pores. Hope it clears up for you!!,1,1,0
Try it out! I recently switched to Differin from Epiduo after discovering my skin really doesn't like benzoyl peroxide. Im about a month in and I still get flaking/peeling but my skin's pretty happy overall :) But you NEED to wear sunscreen, I also didn't realize this was a big reason why it was irritating/peeling my skin so much! Seriously it will cut down on irritation and damage so much if you wear sun protection. ,2,2,0
To Differin - yes yes a million times yes. It's wayyyyy better than epiduo.

Other things - cut out the other undiluted oils which might be aggravating. And focus on skincare rather than 'beauty' products, if you get my meaning.

Using bioderma water as a makeup remover or precleanse before nighttime routine helped me loads too.,1,1,0
It was probably a very deep cyst acne. Ouch. Try a bit of ice? ,9,9,0

PH levels for body soap are different than the PH levels of a face cleanser. PH levels for body soap tend to be higher, as in more alkaline based, so you get that "squeaky clean" sensation. For your face though, it's good to keep it at 5.5. So, in theory, it's safe to use face cleanser for your body, but not always safe to use body cleanser for your face. ,3,3,0
The face is more sensitive than the rest of your skin, so it needs a different product. However, anything you can use on your face you can use on your body (just avoid the sensitive bits),2,2,0

My sister is 18 and she just finished being on accutane for six months. Her skin looked like yours and she has totally cleared up. Her skin is smooth and she is now getting micro-needling for scarring. Even the scars are minimal though. There are side effects but she is so happy. ,27,27,0
Yes! It's a miracle drug. Keep chapstick with you at all times and moisturize your face religiously! It took 5 months for me to clear up and then my skin looked fabulous!,12,12,0
I had really bad acne from 13 to 16. Accutane cleared it up in 6mo when nothing else would work. I defenitley think you should.,9,9,0
Try it, do the blood tests, if you feel shitty and not well, stop taking it. ,7,7,0
Provided you've tried other options, I'd say yes.  

My acne was similar to yours prior to accutane. 2 years later, I still have no persistent acne. Il get a pimple occasionally for a day or two, nothing more. ,4,4,0
Definitely! The side effects are usually minimal (mostly just dry skin!) and can be monitored, but the results are possibly life changing. Don't hesitate, just do it!,4,4,0
Yes! I am 33 and finished in June of this year. It was life changing and I wish I had one on it at your age. I now have acne scars that I'm still embarrassed by. Take care of yourself during the process and you will be so glad you did it,3,3,0
I finished Accutane back in August and it was the best decision I ever made!,3,3,0
Yes. ,3,3,0
My face was just like yours when I was contemplating too when my doctor suggested, and although the side effects can be bad, the alternative is worse IMO. I took Accutane and have never regretted it since, if I had to go back in time and re-do my decision I would have changed nothing. This is why it's known as the last resort, because it's so powerful.,2,2,0
Absolutely yes dude! Do it. Right now. ,2,2,0
Yes man, especially if you're now uncomfortable the way you are and it's been getting worse. **Remember** once you start accutane most all users will break out worse for a little while as the accutane goes in and clears everything out, then you begin to clear up for good!,2,2,0
Im going for it guys! Will do an update when I see that my acne has cleared up upon hearing great things thank you all for the help!,2,2,0

Acne is a clogged pore, so the same pores are just getting clogged again,1,1,0
You sometimes don't have control over a breakout, it can be part of your hormones,4,4,0
Could be lots of things. What kind of acne is it? It could be from dairy, gluten, or some kind of allergy to food. Could be hair in your face or touching your face often. It could be a bacterial or fungal cause, too. ,2,2,0
We feel you, man. I have been having acne problems since I was 14, had 6mo treatment of Accutane twice and relapsed heavily both times. I'm now 20 and still have to battle it, but it has improved significantly due to my diet. What I have learned over the years is that eating properly makes a gigantic difference. If you're very serious about getting rid of your acne for once and for all you should start controlling what you eat heavily. I for one don't consume any dairy products and stay away from greasy food as well as soft drinks and chocolate. This all works very differently for all kinds of people, I've heard of coffee making people break out heavily and you'll just have to experiment with what works for you and what doesn't. Oh and please don't take Accutane too lightly, that shit seriously fucks with your body...think it over well.,3,3,0
Doxycycline didn't help me too. Same thing happened to me, once I was off the medication, my acne returned,2,2,0
Where is your acne most concentrated? Around the jaw line or all over your face?

Sorry to hear about the rude family remarks, that's really shit. People have no idea how destructive acne can be for your self esteem. ,2,2,0
Also i have tried some creams to treat acne. Like treclinac, fucidin. But they didnt helped me. Only thing that helped me was dyxocycline. But help was only temporary while i was using it and 1 week after. Then acne came back again.,1,1,0
Sounds like it's worth it for you, you've tried so many things already.

I did a 9 month course of Accutane and it completely cleared my skin. For me it was a dietary and mineral deficiency (which I realized after my Accutane course). So I've maintained almost completely clear skin.

If you have access to Accutane and you can afford it, I say go for it. Drink lots of water and take it easy on your joints (you can still go to gym just don't do anything you've haven't been doing already). ,1,1,0
Im near 80kg weight.  I would need like 40mg of accutane per day. That would be like 60euros/month. Its like 1/8 my wage. ,1,1,0
What finally worked for me (28 yrs old, have had acne since my teens) was a retinoid cream, Epiduo Forte. My derm wanted me to try that before accurate because it doesn't have the scary side effects of accutane. I was very disheartened at first, thinking it was just another topical that would fail. Lo and behold, my skin is clear and beautiful. It took about 3 months to see results. Maybe worth a try! Good luck, friend. ,1,1,0
Man thats so fucking weird the same thing happened to me. Last winter i was lifting hard eating like crap taking creatine and protein powder but i was barely breaking out and then i got a bunch of pimples stopped lifting cut out dairy again and it got worse. There must be some correlation there wtf,1,1,0
I would recommend trying washing your face only with cold water and what I've learnt from my oily skin experience is that the fewer products I use, the better my skin feels and it heals faster. I think you should stick to only BP or only SA because they both at the same time can do more harm than help. Also, maybe try lower concentration BP, as I've heard that 2,5 % works just as fine as 10% and doesn't irritate skin that much.
Btw, Zinc and Vitamin D3 supplements really helped me with the oiliness situation, you should try it too.,1,1,0

I just use benzoyl peroxide. Dab it on with a q-tip (maybe hold on spot for 30 seconds or so). Repeat as needed, in the morning and at night. This usually dries stuff out and the blemish goes away within 48 hrs. Cheap and super effective. My skin is super sensitive. 

Edit-Hydrogen peroxide, not benzoyl. Whoops! Sorry about that. ,2,2,0
got it done today, was very simple and straight-forward. the aesthetician said it should only take one treatment, maybe two, and I should wait six weeks for full result. it hurt probably 6/10, it was a real burning sensation but also cool at the same time. she did three zap. it caused immediate redness and some swelling, now two hours later it's gone down and looks less red than before. however i know i can still bruise. ,0,0,0

My purge took a month to get bad and start to resolve. 3 months later it was a lot better. Now I’m at 4 months and I’m well on my way to not needing makeup every day to cover red marks, and I have no bumps anymore.

Push through the purge. It sucks and it’s gross and miserable but use the tretinoin as directed and stick with a consistent routine. Totally worth it!!,3,3,0
I personally didn't notice a purge period. This may be because I took it upon myself to ease into using it little by little; 1X/week for two weeks, then 2X/week for a month, etc. paying attention to how my skin was doing and backing off when I felt like it needed a break. That being said, tretinoin saved my skin. I had terrible and inexplicable acne with dark scars and now all my friends tell me how jealous they are of my skin. It's well worth the purge if you want to jump right in.,2,2,0
It’s worked quite well for me...been using it for 2 years. I️ get a hormonal breakout or a random pimple still but nothing like it used to be...used to hurt to even smile. I️ can’t remember how long it took...my skin was so bad that even if I️ had a purge period it felt normal. I️ was doing microderms every week tho too. I️ want to say I️ noticed a good difference in the skin about a month in,1,1,0
Not gonna lie, mine lasted a good 5-6 months. It then started helping but I still had a few spots so upped the strength... purge number 2! Now I'm on Tazorac (which I personally think is a lot stronger/more effective than tret) and my skin hardly ever gets spots! Push through, it's honestly worth it. ,1,1,0
I was lucky and didn't have a purge, but I went right from my previous treatment ( syronolactone and Aczone) to Accutane. Aczone can also have a purge period, which I did experience.,1,1,0

I had some success with ortho tri cyclen but my acne didn’t really measurably improve until I went on spirnolactone. It is technically a blood pressure medication but it lowers androgens in your body which are the usual culprit of hormonal acne in women. It is worth talking to your dr about! ,4,4,0

Yaz was amazing for me! I had hormonal cystic acne. So if you suspect that is what you are dealing with, it should help!

About 5 months ago I went to my gyno and asked to be switched because I was having cystic acne. She prescribed me Bactrim (antibiotic) for 2 weeks and Clindamycin, which is a lotion that I put on morning and night. I also started taking Sprintec at this time. Not sure what did the trick, but my acne is gone for the most part and I credit it to all three of those things in combination.,1,1,0

I've also had horrific breakouts from B12, and am hypersensitive to all B vitamins. I took Biotin with the hope it could help with hair loss from taking Metformin, and my entire chin was a mountain range of cysts. The only vitamin brands I've found that don't have excessive amounts of B and do not cause me to break out are Flintstones with Iron (I take two) or Vitamin Code by Garden of Life. Perhaps a multivitamin that has the B vitamins, but in modest amounts, would be helpful to you as well.

Oh, speaking of Metformin, I've read that it can contribute to a B12 deficiency, so if that's a medicine you're taking it could be another factor.,1,1,0

I've been dealing with acne for 3 months. My acne would turn into dark spots.  I would try everything to get rid of the dark spots, turmeric, apple cider vinegar,  going vegan, drinking a gallon of water a day. Yet, after doing all this for 3 months, no results. I continued to get more acne and dark spots.  Anyways, my girlfriend suggested I try an African black soap. I'm always skeptical when someone suggest that I try a new product because I've spent hundreds of dollars on products that didn't work. Anyways, I tried this product and the results were amazing. The results in the picture were 4 days apart, literally. The product is called "Shea Moisture Acne Prone & Trouble Skin African Black Soap with Shea Butter." Now I'm no sponsor, I'm here to help others out as I'm on my journey to clear my own acne. I was amazed at how fast my dark spots cleared. I should also note that I would always wake up with at least 1 new pimple every morning. It's been 4 days, and I've only woken up with 1  new pimple. Try this product out and let me know how it goes

I also used a Derma Roller 3 days ago for the first time. I used the roller, then washed my face with the African black soap. I don't know which routine is most effect, but I'm going to continue doing whatever I'm doing. ,9,9,0

I literally started using epaderm (super gentle for Psoriasis and eczema, safe for babies etc.) One week ago and I'm already noticing a difference.

I don't have Psoriasis but it appears to have done the best quick job on my acne.,2,2,0
Easy. Don't use comedogenic products. Study each ingredient in your products and make sure it's less than 3 on the comedogenic scale. If you're lazy, look up the product name on http://www.cosdna.com/ and it'll give you an overview of how comedogenic is is (0-5) and how irritating it is (0-5) based on each ingredient.

Also, avoid makeup. Cleanse 2x a day. Don't touch your face. Change your pillowcases every 3-4 days.,1,1,0

I've had many professional and self applied peels.

It will sting, but burning isn't right...if it's that bad they may have left it on too long. Typically for people not used to peels, you leave them on for MAYBE a minute -2 tops depending on the reaction you're experiencing and you build up the time as you use them more.

I've never scabbed. The worst I've had is minor peeling and drier than normal skin if I didn't moisturize properly. I would avoid prolonged sunlight exposure for a while and drink a lot of water to keep your skin hydrated. 

Maybe wait a month or so for another peel. I do mine at home on my own now and rarely leave them on for over 4-5 minutes now that I've built up a bit of a tolerance.,1,1,0
Cetaphil has SLS & irritants. Read the ingredients and study them for each product you use. If diet is in check, then it's your routine that could be causing breakouts. Stress is kind of an indirect cause but even if you don't have acne, stress is terrible for countless reasons.,2,2,0
You sound like me. Your pores could just be... not the greatest... as in prone to oil. Stress definitely causes my acne and an increase in oil production. For your forehead bumps, try washing with Hibiclens. For your blackheads, try stridex pads (although be careful because they can be irritating). Cetaphil also causes irritation in my skin. Try not to touch your face frequently and wash often, as well as it will spur more oil production. Do you consume dairy? ,1,1,0

I highly discourage the use of Accutane. It made my skin worse before it got marginally better and never went away. It made me depressed and suicidal. It’s not worth the mental health risks and doesn’t work for everybody. It’s a huge gamble.,2,2,0

That's understandable for a student. Anyways, from my experience, any brand of whey protein made  me break out and have diarrhea. The only brand that didn't do any of those is the Gold Standard Whey Protein. ,3,3,0

Hi I’m a nutrition student.

Eating any sort of protein powder, significantly raises the level of IGF-1 in the body. Which can trigger the m-TOR activity which is responsible for an icrease in sebum production.

Any form of dairy not only raises your bodies circulating IGF-1 but also contains it naturally as well as estrogen and other things you don’t need.

It is not necessary to get your protein from isolated concentrated sources like this. I get 150 grams of protein per day eating nothing but whole foods.

It’s not as hard as you think seriously. Getting 300g of protein gives you no extra advantage in the gym and is very detrimental to kidney health. When proteins are broken down they expel their amine nitrogen group. Which needs to be expelled from the body immediately.

If you’re eating way too much protein your kidneys may struggle to get rid of it and could cause long term damage.

I recommend 3 servings of beans, lots of nuts seeds, and vegetables and fruit too, for enzyme repair,2,2,0
Why would you consume that much scoops of whey protein? That's some Rich Piana shit lol Whey should be an alternative for when you don't consume enough protein by the end of the day. Lay off the scoops and eat your protein, chicken, beef, etc. I personally only drink whey when I have no time in my day, or when I don't meet my micros by the end of the day. ,-1,-1,0

The no dairy is what cleared those up for me.   You might still get hormonal breakouts even if you stop getting cysts.   If that is the case go see a dermatologist if you can or a clinic that specializes in acne.   They will get you on treatments and products that will clear you up.

Stop picking asap!! It’s probably spreading it. Find a new bad habit...pick at your scalp or fingernails instead...not the best advice but you’ve gotta let your skin heal on your face!

Have you tried proactiv? I know it seems gimmicky but it’s actually good to have a system. Be really consistent with what you use. Get a face wash with salicylic acid in it. The wash you’re using now is body wash? I wouldn’t use it on your face. The skin on your body is tougher than your delicate facial skin. ,2,2,0
Accutane should not be your first choice. It was the only thing that worked for me, but there are many alternatives prior.

Accutane did not work for me. I started on it when I was 13ish. It made my skin worse before getting marginally better but never, ever cured my acne. What’s worse, it made me extremely depressed and suicidal. It should be no means be anything other than a very reluctant last resort.,1,1,0
